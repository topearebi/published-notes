We can vary the tense or value (+ -)\nA is the carriage or subject of the sentence. B is the thing the carriage is\nSakura ga nihonjin\nA does B\nIn Japanese が (ga) is the linchpin of every sentence, even when you cannot see it. It is used to hook A and B to form a sentence\nExample\nSakura walks\nSakura ga aruku\nあるく (aruku) walks\n“mainly comes after nouns and indicates the subject of a sentence. It shows who does the action that comes after the subject.” NHK World Japan\nConnective da. “To be”. Connects the verb and complement\nだ (da) is another core particle. It is the simplest form of です (desu) which is how it is used in most speech. It tell us that A “is” B. Using it with the wrong subject confuses the meaning in context because B is not always A.\nSakura ga nihonjin da\nAdjective い (i)\ni is added to the end of a word to make it descriptive.\nIn english, a lot of adjective end with y as well. Happy, sunny etc\nい mean is-adjective. So it replaces ga が\nWhen using a い adjective, だ is not necessary.\nLesson 2: Omitting the subject\nThe invisible carriage\nReplacing the subject of the sentence with something like “it”. While it is used in English, in Japanese, it can be omitted\nJapanese relies more on topic and context\nEssentially, subject pronouns are not crucial in japanese\nExample\nWatashi ga Abdullahi da(de su) = Abdullahi da(desu)\nWatashi ga becomes invisible\nを　The wo or o carriage\nIt represents the object of the sentence\nwo/o is not part of A is B or A does B. it adds context to A or B\nExample\nA                                 B\nwatashi-ga keeki-wo taberu\nhere, wo tells us more about the B part of the sentence. Cake is what is being eaten\nThe invisible carriage allows us convert this to\nkeeki-wo taberu\nLesson 3\nthe wa particle is a non-logical particle\nWa is not a core sentence composition. It is not part of A, B or wo. A noun marked with was is not part of the sentence logic,\nWa is a flag. It only indicates that a noun is the topic of the sentence\nwa = as for. as for me, as for cars, as for this topic\nExample\nWatashi wa, Amerikajin da\nAs for me, am American. This is wrong in both English and Japanese\nThis is because we are omitting the actual sentence carriage “ga”\nThe invisible carriage here still exists to make this make sense. The full sentence would be\nwatashi wa, (watashi) ga, amerikajin da\nThe logical trio\nを (wo), が (ga), に (ni)\nが (ga) tells us who does what\nを (wo) - what it is being done to\nに (ni) - ultimate target of the action\nAll sentences have ga, but not necessarily wi or ni\n\nGa is always present, even when it is invisible\n\nInsights\n\nquote 1\n\nInsight 1\n\nquote 2\n\nInsight 2\nSummary\nKey concepts\n\ntheme 1\ntheme 2\n\nCritical Analysis\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nDisagreements\nAgreements\nReal-world applications\nConnections\nOther literature\nFleeting notes\nPermanent notes\nStructure notes"},"articles/project-notes/DIY-Hair-and-Scalp-Care-Products-for-4C-Afro-Hair-1f2635c581e08028b4dce75910a44749":{"slug":"articles/project-notes/DIY-Hair-and-Scalp-Care-Products-for-4C-Afro-Hair-1f2635c581e08028b4dce75910a44749","filePath":"articles/project-notes/DIY Hair and Scalp Care Products for 4C Afro Hair 1f2635c581e08028b4dce75910a44749.md","title":"DIY Hair and Scalp Care Products for 4C Afro Hair 1f2635c581e08028b4dce75910a44749","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"DIY Hair and Scalp Care Products for 4C Afro Hair\nDIY Leave-In Conditioner for Thick, Coarse, and Dry Hair\nCarrier oils: Choose 2-3 carrier oils depending on your desired result.\nHydrating agents: Aloe vera gel, glycerin, honey, or panthenol (vitamin B5) will lock in moisture and prevent dryness.\nStrength-building proteins: Wheat germ oil, rice bran oil, or hydrolyzed silk proteins will help strengthen and prevent breakage.\nDetangling agents: Apple cider vinegar or slippery elm powder will reduce frizz and make combing easier.\nPreservatives: Optiphen Plus or Geogard ECT will prevent your conditioner from spoiling too quickly.\nIngredients and Ratios\nCarrier Oils (2-3 oils):\nFor deep hydration, try coconut oil, avocado oil, or olive oil (use sparingly).

The modern word probably has been influenced in sense by muse (n.). Related: Mused; musing.\nalso from mid-14c.\nMuse(n.)late 14c., “one of the nine Muses of classical mythology,” daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, protectors of the arts; from Old French Muse and directly from Latin Musa, from Greek Mousa, “the Muse,” also “music, song,” ultimately from PIE root *men- (1) “to think.” Meaning “inspiring goddess of a particular poet” (with a lower-case m-) is from late 14c.\nThe traditional names and specialties of the nine Muses are: Calliope (epic poetry), Clio (history), Erato (love poetry, lyric art), Euterpe (music, especially flute), Melpomene (tragedy), Polymnia (hymns), Terpsichore (dance), Thalia (comedy), Urania (astronomy).\namuse(v.)late 15c., “to divert the attention, beguile, delude,” from Old French amuser “fool, tease, hoax, entrap; make fun of,” literally “cause to muse” (as a distraction), from a “at, to” (from Latin ad, but here probably a causal prefix) + muser “ponder, stare fixedly” (see muse (v.)).\nThe original English senses are obsolete; the meaning “divert from serious business, tickle the fancy of” is recorded from 1630s, but through 18c. the primary meaning was “deceive, cheat” by first occupying the attention. “The word was not in reg. use bef. 1600, and was not used by Shakespere” [OED]. Bemuse retains more of the original meaning. Greek amousos meant “without Muses,” hence “uneducated.”"},"articles/project-notes/Everything-SQL-172635c581e08076acf5c40de4463bc8":{"slug":"articles/project-notes/Everything-SQL-172635c581e08076acf5c40de4463bc8","filePath":"articles/project-notes/Everything SQL 172635c581e08076acf5c40de4463bc8.md","title":"Everything SQL 172635c581e08076acf5c40de4463bc8","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Everything SQL\n[Cloud Engineering Roadmap| Tech With Soleyman](www.notion.so/Cloud-Engineering-Roadmap-Tech-With-Soleyman-16b635c581e080a28bbbdbcc27daba13) 6-Week Data Science Learning Plan\n\nAll SQL versions must support SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE\nTo build a website with SQL I need:\n\nA relational database management system eg MySQL\nTo use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP\nTo use SQL to get the data you want\nTo use HTML / CSS to style the page\n\n\n"},"articles/project-notes/Fabric-Guide":{"slug":"articles/project-notes/Fabric-Guide","filePath":"articles/project-notes/Fabric Guide.md","title":"Fabric Guide","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Tags: miscellaneous\nFabrics of different types have different handling properties\nContent\nHemp\n\nAlternative Names: Cannabis sativa\nDescription: A strong, durable natural fiber derived from the hemp plant.

And so I spent another 90 days understanding not only how I had spent those first 3 months, but the outcomes and what I could have done to improve on them.\nMy awakening to product management as a career path which I have discussed in a previous article, happened late in 2021. Since then I have attended a Product Management bootcamp, completed several Udemy courses on related topics and been building in stealth with a great team. I have also been an Associate Product Manager at Decagon since April 2022, and it is from this experience that this article draws from.\nI particularly love working at Decagon because it is a mission-led organisation looking to make Nigeria into the next tech-capital of the world by training elite software engineers for the world’s tech talent market. It is easy to appreciate how transformative it could be for not just Nigeria, but the world One thing that I particularly love about working at Decagon is that it is a mission-led organisation looking to make Nigeria into the next tech-capital of the world by training software engineers. Anyone can immediately appreciate just how how transformative succeeding at this would be. What this means is that your KPIs are not just deliverables to further the business, they are literally checkpoints on the road to change the world.\nBecause of the nature of this mission, I am quite often working with a lot of junior and unskilled developers. It is my job to train not only their product sense, but their understanding of the scrum framework and the agile software development process.\nThis is peculiar because as a recent addition to the Product Management scene myself, I am spending my learning period teaching people this should be in my learning phase. Yet, this experience has forced me to upskill rather rapidly. I have built and iterated more products in the last 6 months than some product managers do in their first 2 years.\nUnderstand the business\nThis probably goes without saying but the first thing you need to do is to understand the business you are in.\nFind out all there is to know about your company, not just the product. You need to understand the organisation’s goals, objectives, what your stakeholders value. You need to understand the market. You will have all sort of ideas and features because you have fresh eyes, but what market is your product addressing and what are the peculiarities of that market\nBe humble\nIf your company is not at literAL DAY ONE, you need to understand that many of your ideas have probably been considered by more experienced and senior members of the business and may already be in the roadmap. You need to understand the visions and roadmap. Talk to people and find out what they are working on and what they’ve worked on. If you have a product team, do not go straight to your boss with an idea you haven’t thought of Collaborate and it will make your proposal stronger and give it more weight that you were able to get buy in from someone your manager probably already trusts\nForget the Job Description\nBuild a Team\nDepending on your team size.\nBetter PM\nand a and so my unofficial title has really been Product Manager/Scrum Master vs Agile coach. I have a lot to learn and yet I have learned a lot as well. Here’s what I learned about how to spend your first 90 days as a PM\nwith a gr side project that is still I began my first structured PM role at Decagon just 6 months ago so needless to say, I still have a lot to learn. One amazing thing about my current organisation however is simply the amount of learning opportunities available. As a training institute itself, Decagon is no stranger to the importance of upskilling and continued education. Not to mention that I have an amazing line manager with who I believe I share similar values in terms professional commitment and development and who I am constantly learning from.\nOne peculiar thing about my career is that I work a lot of nascent developers myself. As a Product Manager, it falls on me not just to own the product outcome, but the individua outcomes of the team members as well. I must make sure that not only is the development team creating value for the product, but that the product is creating value for the development team."},"articles/project-notes/Freelance-Project-Manager-Author-16c635c581e0806fa10ed5a9de2d1e9b":{"slug":"articles/project-notes/Freelance-Project-Manager-Author-16c635c581e0806fa10ed5a9de2d1e9b","filePath":"articles/project-notes/Freelance Project Manager Author 16c635c581e0806fa10ed5a9de2d1e9b.md","title":"Freelance Project Manager Author 16c635c581e0806fa10ed5a9de2d1e9b","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Freelance Project Manager| Author |\nInsights\n\nquote 1\n\nInsight 1\n\nquote 2\n\nInsight 2\nSummary\nBusiness structure\nOutside IR35\nGet an accountant\nOpen a business bank account\nInside IR35\nStart an umbrella company, get paid by an umbrella company\nSet your dayrate\nFlood the market with your CV.

Find a reliable online tutorial (YouTube is great for visuals) or a beginner’s book specifically for models that go a bit beyond the super simple crane or boat. Look for models labelled “easy-intermediate” or that introduce specific base folds (like the Bird Base or Frog Base). Practise making clean, precise folds – precision is key as you move to more complex models.\nSustainability: Highly sustainable. Origami has immense depth, from mastering complex existing models (some take hours!) to exploring modular origami (creating large structures from many identical units) and even designing your own models (where the mathematical aspect really comes in). There’s a large online community sharing designs and techniques.\n\nAmateur Etymology:\n\nStarting Point: Get access to a good online etymological dictionary (like Etymonline.com or the etymology section of Wiktionary). Simply start with words you use every day or words you’re curious about and look them up. Follow the threads – if a word comes from Latin, look up the Latin root and see what other English words come from it.\nSustainability: Very sustainable. Language is constantly evolving, and there are endless words to explore. You can specialise in words from a particular source language (like Greek or Old English), words related to a specific topic (like science or cooking), or delve into the history of idioms and phrases. It’s a never-ending process of discovery.\n\nAdvanced Logic Puzzles:\n\nStarting Point: Pick one type of advanced logic puzzle that looks interesting (like Slitherlink, Hitori, Kakuro, or Nonograms). Find a website, app, or book that offers puzzles of that type specifically labelled as “Easy” or “Beginner.” Learn the rules thoroughly and work through those easy puzzles to get a feel for the basic deduction techniques.\nSustainability: Extremely sustainable. There are thousands of different logic puzzle types, and within each type, the difficulty can be scaled up to be incredibly challenging. Competitive puzzling offers another layer of engagement. You will constantly find new types to learn and harder puzzles to test your skills on.\n\nCiphership and Cryptanalysis (Classical):\n\nStarting Point: Begin by learning the simplest historical ciphers: the Caesar cipher and the Rail Fence cipher. Understand how they work. Immediately follow this by learning their corresponding cryptanalysis methods (like trying all possible shifts for Caesar). Find online resources or introductory books on “classical cryptography” that provide practice messages for these simple ciphers. Try encrypting and decrypting your own messages.\nSustainability: Highly sustainable. While the historical ciphers themselves are finite, the process of learning them, understanding the history of code-making and breaking, and applying the cryptanalysis techniques to solve practice problems offers deep engagement. You can progress through increasingly complex historical ciphers (Vigenère, Playfair, etc.) and learn more sophisticated breaking techniques. The blend of history, logic, and puzzle-solving provides lasting interest.\n\nFormal Logic and Proof Study:\n\nStarting Point: Find an introductory resource specifically on Propositional Logic. This is the foundational level. Look for free online courses (like those sometimes offered on platforms like Coursera or edX, or open university materials) or a beginner-friendly textbook on Symbolic or Formal Logic. Focus on understanding the basic logical symbols (AND, OR, NOT, IF…THEN) and, crucially, start working through the exercises on translating sentences into symbols and constructing simple proofs using the first few rules of inference you learn.\nSustainability: Highly sustainable. Formal logic is a deep academic field with many branches (Predicate Logic, Modal Logic, etc.). As a hobbyist, you can spend years working through different logical systems, exploring proof techniques, and even touching on related areas like the philosophy or mathematics of logic. The challenge and the satisfaction of constructing rigorous proofs provide ongoing engagement.\n\nAmateur Anatomy and Physiology Study:\n\nWhat it involves: Learning the structure (anatomy) and function (physiology) of the human body. This can range from understanding the major organ systems down to the cellular level.\nStarting Point: Get a good introductory resource. Look for a widely used first-year university-level Anatomy and Physiology textbook (libraries are excellent for this, or look for affordable older editions or free online versions like OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology). Many excellent websites, apps, and YouTube channels offer clear explanations and visualisations of anatomy. Start with a foundational system like the skeletal system (bones) or muscular system, which provide a good framework. Focus on learning the names and locations of key structures and their basic functions.\nSustainability: Highly sustainable. The human body is immensely complex. You can spend years studying different systems (nervous, cardiovascular, endocrine, etc.), delving into microscopic anatomy (histology), or exploring the physiology of how systems work together. There’s always more to learn.\n"},"articles/project-notes/How-Models-work---Kaggle-7ea8163d1df94d69aeaa21b713f926a5":{"slug":"articles/project-notes/How-Models-work---Kaggle-7ea8163d1df94d69aeaa21b713f926a5","filePath":"articles/project-notes/How Models work - Kaggle 7ea8163d1df94d69aeaa21b713f926a5.md","title":"How Models work - Kaggle 7ea8163d1df94d69aeaa21b713f926a5","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"How Models work - Kaggle\nStart with decision tree.\nA decision tree Auto with a question condition\nIf yes ⇒ Do this\nIf no ⇒ Do that\nThe process of capturing these patterns from a date set is called “fitting” or “training” your model\nThe data used to do this is called a “training data” The prediction at the bottom of the th decision tree is a leaf.\nUsing Pandas\nimport pandas as pd\nPandas gives access to DataFrame.

Consistency is key to achieving healthy, glowing skin.\nHere is a comparison of the key skincare ingredients you asked about:\nHyaluronic Acid:\n\nA powerful humectant that can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, providing deep, long-lasting hydration.[1][2][3]\nHelps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by plumping and firming the skin.[1][2][3]\nImproves skin elasticity and promotes a more youthful, radiant complexion.[1][2][3]\n\nNiacinamide:\n\nA form of vitamin B3 that helps regulate oil production, minimize pores, and even out skin tone.[1][2][4]\nHas anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce redness and treat acne.[1][2][4]\nStrengthens the skin’s protective barrier and protects against environmental damage.[1][2][4]\n\nVitamin C:\n\nA potent antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals to prevent collagen breakdown and premature aging.[2][5]\nBrightens the skin, fades dark spots, and inhibits melanin production for a more even complexion.[2][5]\nWorks synergistically with vitamin E to provide enhanced protection against oxidative stress.[2][3]\n\nVitamin E:\n\nAnother antioxidant that helps maintain the skin’s barrier function and improve the appearance of scars and sun damage.[3]\nProvides additional protection against environmental aggressors when used with vitamin C.[2][3]\n\nRetinol:\n\nA form of vitamin A that stimulates collagen production and cell turnover to reduce fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation.\nCan cause dryness and irritation, especially for sensitive skin, so it’s important to start with low concentrations and build tolerance.\n\nKojic Acid:\n\nDerived from fungi, it inhibits melanin production to fade dark spots and even out skin tone.\nHas mild exfoliating properties that can improve texture and brightness.\nMay cause redness or sensitivity in some individuals.\n\nArbutin:\n\nA natural skin-lightening agent that reduces melanin production to target hyperpigmentation.\nConsidered a gentler alternative to hydroquinone, another common skin-lightening ingredient.\nEffective but can take several weeks to see results.\n\nCaffeine:\n\nProvides a temporary tightening and de-puffing effect when applied topically.\nCan help reduce the appearance of under-eye bags and dark circles.\nWorks best when combined with other soothing, hydrating ingredients.\n\nLicorice Root:\n\nContains glabridin, which has anti-inflammatory and skin-brightening properties.\nHelps calm redness and irritation while fading discoloration.\nSuitable for sensitive skin types.\n\nAHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acids):\n\nWater-soluble acids derived from sugary fruits\nExfoliate the surface of the skin to improve texture, reduce fine lines, and even out tone\nExamples include glycolic acid and lactic acid\nGenerally safe for all skin types, but may cause initial dryness or irritation\n\nBHA (Beta Hydroxy Acids):\n\nOil-soluble acids like salicylic acid\nPenetrate deeper into the pores to remove excess oil and dead skin cells\nEffective for treating acne, blackheads, and sun damage\nMay be better suited for oily or acne-prone skin\n\nPHA (Polyhydroxy Acids):\n\nLarger molecule size than AHAs and BHAs\nProvide gentle exfoliation with less irritation\nHelp improve skin hydration and barrier function\nSuitable for sensitive skin types\n\nCeramides:\n\nNatural lipids found in the skin’s outer layer\nHelp strengthen and repair the skin barrier\nImprove moisture retention and prevent water loss\nBeneficial for dry, dehydrated, or compromised skin\n\nSalicylic Acid (a type of BHA):\n\nOil-soluble, penetrates into pores\nHas anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties\nEffective for treating acne, reducing redness and swelling\nMay cause dryness if overused, so should be introduced gradually\n\nIn summary, AHAs and BHAs are both exfoliating acids that improve skin texture and tone, but differ in their solubility and target skin concerns. PHAs offer a gentler alternative, while ceramides help strengthen the skin barrier. Salicylic acid is a specific type of BHA with unique benefits for acne-prone skin.\nCitations:\n[1] Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Salicylic Acid - What are they Good For? skincancerderm.com/hyaluronic-acid-salicylic-acid-what-are-they-good-for/\n[2] Why You Need to Know the Difference Between Hyaluronic Acid and Salicy myeclatshop.com/blogs/the-eclat-edit/hyaluronic-acid-vs-salicylic-acid\n[3] Skincare Acids Guide - lluillui www.lluillui.com/blog/post/skincare-acids-guide/\n[4] How to layer acids in your skincare routine explained - Sublime Life sublimelife.in/blogs/sublime-stories/how-to-layer-acids-to-get-maximum-results\n[5] Hydroxy Acids, the Most Widely Used Anti-aging Agents - PMC - NCBI www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941867/\nIn summary, these ingredients offer a range of benefits for the skin, from hydration and anti-aging to acne treatment and brightening.

Toners were originally developed to remove soap scum from the face when lye-based soaps combined with hard water left a sticky residue post cleansing. The alcohol-based toner removed the soap scum eliminating irritation and contributing to cleanser mildness.\nOn eye creams\nHelp the look of fine lines and wrinkles.According to the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, there are multiple studies supporting eye creams as an effective method for enhancing the smoothness and appearance of larger wrinkles around the eyes.\neye creams “may not be necessary for everyone,” but she recommends it for those “who are concerned about their undereye area or who are noticing changes in the undereye area.”\nUnlike regular moisturizers, eye creams are formulated to be lightweight and easily absorbed, preventing milia or oil buildup in the sensitive eye region.\nSuch a cream likely contains a higher concentration of active ingredients designed to combat fine lines. It’s worth noting the irony that eye creams, although often pricier than facial moisturizers, may have a more specialized formulation that is gentler on the delicate skin around the eyes.\nThe Takeaway. Eye cream is an effective addition to your skincare routine, especially if you have specific under-eye issues that you’re hoping to correct. But, if you’re simply looking to hydrate the eye area and don’t suffer from dark circles, puffiness, or wrinkles, you can absolutely use your go-to moisturizer."},"articles/project-notes/How-to-build-a-wardrobe":{"slug":"articles/project-notes/How-to-build-a-wardrobe","filePath":"articles/project-notes/How to build a wardrobe.md","title":"How to build a wardrobe","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Guide to Building a Versatile Wardrobe\nBuilding a wardrobe requires thoughtful selection of materials, styles, and brands. Here’s a comprehensive guide to curate a wardrobe that is timeless, functional, and sustainable.\n\nFabric Selection:\nBase Layers\n\nOpt for breathable fabrics like cotton, hemp, bamboo, ramie, linen, or Tencel for items that touch your skin directly and for everyday wear.\n\nSummer Wear\n\nFocus on linen for its breathability but ensure it’s not see-through. Silk shirts, especially 100% mulberry silk with textures like knitted or hammered, are easy to wear.\nSelect silk garments, especially 100% mulberry silk, for luxurious texture.\n\nWinter Wear\n\nChoose wool and cashmere blends for warmth and luxury but without excessive polyester content.\nFor winter coats, avoid polyester content above 20% unless it’s blended with alpaca or cashmere (up to 30%).\nPolyester content above 50% can lead to pilling and poor insulation.\nWool and cashmere blends provide warmth, luxury, and a less flashy appearance at a lower cost.\nLinen and silk offer a silky-smooth, durable, and breathable option.\nCotton and linen are a more affordable yet still breathable combination.\n\nDenim\n\nOpt for 100% cotton jeans over blended materials for durability and comfort.\n\nCashmere\n\nLook for Grade A, B, or C cashmere for warmth and quality. Cashmere is warmer than wool and easier to wash. Look for Grade A, B, or C cashmere based on fibre length and ply. Good cashmere should be soft and resistant to pilling.\nSteer clear of cashmere and polyester blends, as they can compromise the quality and performance of the cashmere.\n\nBrands to Consider:\n\nArket\nCOS\nMassimo Dutti\nBoulder Skins\nAll Saints\n\nKey Pieces for All Seasons:\n\nTops:\n\nCotton or silk shirts for summer.\nSilk shirts for a luxurious touch.\nFitted t-shirts and high-quality sweaters (wool or cashmere) for layering.\n\n\nBottoms:\n\nJeans: Opt for 100% cotton over blends.\nChinos: Versatile and comfortable.\nLinen pants or shorts for summer.\n\n\nOuterwear:\n\nTailored wool coats for winter.\nInvest in a structured blazer for formal occasions.\n\n\nFootwear:\n\nLoafers, oxfords, or white leather sneakers for versatility.\nBirkenstocks for casual comfort.\n\n\n\nShopping Tips:\n\nThrifting: Wear simple clothes for easy changing. Carry a tie to check against shirts and have socks on to try shoes.\nMeasurements: Keep your measurements handy for accurate fitting.\nQuality Check: Inspect buttons, buttonholes, and fabric tags for durability and quality.\n\nStyling Rules:\n\nNeutral Palette: Stick to timeless colors like brown, beige, black, charcoal, white, and navy.\nFit: Avoid extremes like skinny or baggy fits. Aim for tailored or slim fits.\nMaterials: Embrace natural fabrics like linen, wool, leather, cashmere, and cotton for durability and comfort.\n\nAdditional Tips:\n\nInvestment Pieces: Prioritize quality over quantity, especially with essential items like coats, suits, and shoes.\nNo Logos: Embrace a minimalist aesthetic without visible branding.\nMix &amp; Match: Opt for versatile pieces that can be dressed up or down for various occasions.\n\nBuilding a Summer Wardrobe:\n\nVests/Tank Tops: Both free and fitted options for layering.\nBasic T-Shirts: Various colors in cotton or similar fabrics.\nLinen Shirts: Long and short-sleeved options for breathability.\nShorts and Pants: Linen or cotton options with adjustable fits.\n\nWardrobe Basics:\n\nFootwear: Ensure you have a range of comfortable yet stylish shoes.\nTailored Blazer: Navy or grey for formal or smart-casual occasions.\n"},"articles/project-notes/Languages/Arabic":{"slug":"articles/project-notes/Languages/Arabic","filePath":"articles/project-notes/Languages/Arabic.md","title":"Arabic","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"articles/project-notes/Languages/Crash-Learning-Languages":{"slug":"articles/project-notes/Languages/Crash-Learning-Languages","filePath":"articles/project-notes/Languages/Crash Learning Languages.md","title":"Crash Learning Languages","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Core Categories\nGreetings &amp; Essential Politeness:\nHello/Hi:\nGoodbye:\nPlease:\nThank you (very much):\nYou’re welcome:\nExcuse me/Sorry: (e.g., to get attention or apologise)\nIntroductions &amp; Connection:\nMy name is ‘Your Name’:\nWhat’s your name?:\nNice to meet you:\nYes/No:\nShowing You’re Learning &amp; Managing Communication:\nI am learning ‘Language’:\nI speak a little ‘Language’:\nI don’t understand:\nCan you repeat, please?:\nHow do you say “‘word in English’” in ‘Language’?:\nSlowly, please:\nSimple Questions &amp; Statements:\nHow are you?:\nI’m fine, thank you.

If a friend does not serve you, it strains the relationship\nGiven the events of the past few weeks, I believe that ach and everyone of us wants to be here. That is why we are here And based on that belief, I believe that we are entering into ever conversation, every agreement, in good faith that we are looking to deliver the best that we can. That we all want to create value. For ourselves and for the business And to continue to be here, we must align our goals with those of the business\nBut the responsibility does not stop there. Because we also have a responsibility to each other. Assume that the other person is giving their best to their work, and respond in kind by giving your best too. Not just the best that you think you personally can, but the best that the team deserves if you want it to be great\nYou are the core development team of a startup business. You are building this business with your own hands line by line\nIf perhaps you don’t have faith in the business, consider that without working product, we have customers that literally go through the hassle of manually using the product. That shows that there is. real need. There are people that want what you are building.\nIf it fails, we have all failed.

It forms a protective barrier on the skin’s surface, preventing moisture loss and promoting hydration throughout the day.\nNourishing Properties: Shea butter is packed with vitamins A, E, and F, as well as essential fatty acids, which nourish and replenish the skin, leaving it feeling soft, supple, and revitalized. These nutrients also help promote skin cell regeneration, aiding in the repair of damaged skin and reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\nAnti-Inflammatory: Shea butter has anti-inflammatory properties that can help soothe irritated skin and calm redness and inflammation. It’s particularly beneficial for conditions like eczema, psoriasis, and dermatitis, providing relief from itchiness and discomfort.\nAntioxidant Protection: Vitamin E oil is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect the skin from environmental damage and oxidative stress caused by free radicals. It helps to neutralize free radicals, which can accelerate the aging process and contribute to the formation of wrinkles and fine lines.\n\nHow to Make:\n\nIn a heat-safe bowl, melt the shea butter using a double boiler or microwave until it becomes liquid.\nOnce melted, remove the shea butter from heat and allow it to cool slightly.\nAdd the jojoba oil and vitamin E oil to the melted shea butter and stir well to combine.\nTransfer the mixture to a clean, airtight container, such as a glass jar or tin, and allow it to cool and solidify at room temperature.\nOnce solidified, your nourishing shea butter cream is ready to use. Simply scoop out a small amount and massage it onto clean, dry skin, focusing on areas that need extra hydration and nourishment.\n\nStorage: Store the shea butter cream in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to preserve its potency and prevent it from melting. Use within a few months for best results.\nThis DIY moisturizer is perfect for those with dry or mature skin who are looking for a rich, nourishing treatment to replenish and rejuvenate their complexion. Incorporate it into your skincare routine to enjoy its hydrating and anti-aging benefits, leaving your skin feeling soft, smooth, and radiant.\nSkin Types or Conditions Benefiting Most:\n\nDry Skin: This shea butter cream is especially beneficial for individuals with dry skin, as it provides intense hydration and helps to replenish lost moisture. The emollient properties of shea butter help to soften and smooth dry patches, leaving the skin feeling hydrated and nourished.\nMature Skin: Mature skin tends to be drier and more prone to fine lines and wrinkles. The nourishing ingredients in this cream, such as shea butter and vitamin E oil, help to hydrate and rejuvenate mature skin, promoting elasticity and firmness while reducing the appearance of aging signs.\nSensitive Skin: Individuals with sensitive skin can also benefit from this gentle moisturizer, as it contains natural ingredients that are less likely to cause irritation. Shea butter has soothing properties that can help calm sensitive skin, while vitamin E oil provides antioxidant protection against environmental stressors.\n\nPrecautions or Considerations:\n\nAllergic Reactions: While shea butter is generally well-tolerated by most skin types, individuals with nut allergies should use caution when using products containing shea butter, as it is derived from the nut of the shea tree. Perform a patch test before applying the cream to your face to check for any allergic reactions.\nComedogenicity: Shea butter has a moderately high comedogenic rating, which means it may clog pores for some individuals, especially those with oily or acne-prone skin. If you have concerns about pore-clogging, consider using this cream primarily as a night treatment or adjusting the recipe to include lighter oils with lower comedogenic ratings.\n\nCustomization Options:\n\nEssential Oils: Add a few drops of essential oils like lavender, chamomile, or frankincense for additional skin benefits and a pleasant fragrance. These oils have soothing and anti-inflammatory properties that can enhance the effectiveness of the moisturizer.\nHydrating Additions: Incorporate hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid or aloe vera gel to boost the moisturizing properties of the cream, especially for extremely dry skin.\nAnti-Aging Boost: Consider adding a small amount of rosehip oil or evening primrose oil to the recipe for extra anti-aging benefits. These oils are rich in antioxidants and essential fatty acids that help improve skin tone and texture.\nTexture Adjustments: Adjust the ratios of shea butter and oils to customize the texture of the cream based on your preferences. More shea butter will result in a thicker, richer consistency, while less shea butter and more oils will create a lighter, more spreadable texture.\n\nBy considering these factors and making appropriate adjustments, you can tailor the shea butter cream to meet your specific skincare needs and preferences, ensuring optimal results and satisfaction."},"articles/project-notes/The-Network-1e2635c581e08076abfde1dfaef731f1":{"slug":"articles/project-notes/The-Network-1e2635c581e08076abfde1dfaef731f1","filePath":"articles/project-notes/The Network 1e2635c581e08076abfde1dfaef731f1.md","title":"The Network 1e2635c581e08076abfde1dfaef731f1","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Network\nIdeas -\nCoffee, Whatsapp group, professional speaking/class, social presentation/slideshow\nPeople -\n\nOyinda\nAbdullahi\nJerry\nJerry’s wife\nSomto\nSomto’s wife\nUkara\nHarry\nCollins\nTosin\nKunle\nBuchi\n"},"articles/project-notes/The-Wardrobe-1b1635c581e0809eb092e4f1fb10da63":{"slug":"articles/project-notes/The-Wardrobe-1b1635c581e0809eb092e4f1fb10da63","filePath":"articles/project-notes/The Wardrobe 1b1635c581e0809eb092e4f1fb10da63.md","title":"The Wardrobe 1b1635c581e0809eb092e4f1fb10da63","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Wardrobe\nContent:\n\nWork uniform\n\nDark grey merino wool sweater\nWhite cotton poplin shirt\nNavy blue silk tie\nCharcoal Grey wool pants\nBlack belt\nBlack Oxfords shoes\nGrey wool socks (match trousers)\nSilver Cufflinks\nCharcoal Grey suit jacket\nAlternatives: dark green/white/dark grey(green)/\n\n\nWeekend\n\nTailored navy Chinos\nWhite linen shirt\nDark grey V-necks merino wool sweater\nBrown leather belt\nBrown loafers\nBlazer\n\n\nLoungewear\n\nDark grey cashmere joggers\nCharcoal grey merino wool Henley shirt\nDark grey cashmere socks\nBlack leather slippers\nCashmere robe\n\n\n\nQuarter Zip Jumper\nDark green\nMerino Wool V-Neck Jumper\nCharcoal/Dark Gray/Navy blue\nCrew Neck Jumper\nGrey\nSleeveless vest\nBlack/White/Olive\nLinen Shirt\nCream/Navy/Grey/White\nCotton Shirt\n3 White/3 Black\nHenley Shirt\nGrey/Blue/Beige\nLeather Gloves\nBlack riding gloves\nSocks\nBlack/Grey/Brown/Navy\nBlazer\nGrey/Charcoal/Brown\nTie\nNavy/Grey/Brown\nWallet\nBlack\nChinos\nNavy/Drak brown/Beige/Gray\nJoggers\nGray/Black/Dark Brown\nShoes\nWhite leather/"},"articles/project-notes/The-art-of-sensual-massage-65259294273546cfb118738342aa6f35":{"slug":"articles/project-notes/The-art-of-sensual-massage-65259294273546cfb118738342aa6f35","filePath":"articles/project-notes/The art of sensual massage 65259294273546cfb118738342aa6f35.md","title":"The art of sensual massage 65259294273546cfb118738342aa6f35","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The art of sensual massage\nInsights\n\nquote 1\n\nInsight 1\n\nquote 2\n\nInsight 2\nSummary\nMassage session tips\n\nChoose a vegetable oil, except peanut or corn oil, for the massage base. Consider coconut oil for its clean properties or safflower oil for affordability.\nHeat the oil using a coffee warmer or candle to avoid shocking your partner with cold oil.\nScent the oil with essential extracts, perfume, or lemon juice to create a desired mood.\nApply the oil in small amounts using circular strokes, focusing on areas that need more oil like hairy parts.\nWipe off excess oil with a soft towel throughout the massage. Avoid using rubbing alcohol as it can be too harsh on the skin.\n\nCreating a relaxing massage ambience:\n\nLighting: Use soft, indirect lighting like a lamp or candles.\nSound: Opt for calming music like flutes, classical guitar, or nature sounds. If outdoors, listen to the ambient sounds.\nTemperature: Maintain a warm room temperature (at least 75 degrees Fahrenheit) and ensure your hands are warm before starting.\nBody: Let your partner take a warm bath or shower before the massage.\nSurface: Provide a firm and level surface for your partner to lie on.\n\nMassaging the abdomen and chest:\n\nStart the massage in the abdomen as it’s the center of the body and can help spread relaxation evenly.\nUse slow and even strokes, focusing on increasing the number of movements rather than applying heavy pressure.\nPay attention to the digestive area as it can influence mood and muscle tension throughout the body.\n\nThe swimming stroke is a great massage technique for the abdomen and chest:\n\nUse flat hands and apply gentle pressure as you slide them across the body.\nRepeat the strokes three times, then move your hands up three inches and repeat.\nCover the entire abdomen and chest area, up to the shoulders but avoiding the throat.\nWhen reaching the shoulders, move down to the abdomen and then back up.\nInclude the breasts when massaging a woman; avoid stopping and starting around them.\n\nStroking beneath the lower ribs during a massage:\n\nUse your three middle fingers and apply moderate pressure as you trace a line parallel to the lower ribs.\nStart in the center of the body and move towards the side.\nLift your hands and return to the center to begin again.\nMaintain a consistent timing for lifting your hands to keep the massage rhythm flowing.\n\nDraining the colon massage technique is said to aid digestion and relax muscles in the intestinal cavity. Here’s how to perform it:\n\nAsk your partner to raise their knees for better access.\nUse both hands in a circular motion, one following the other.\nStroke with the palm of your left hand and apply pressure with the fingertips of your right hand.\nMove your right hand in a U-shape across your partner’s abdomen, following the colon.\nMaintain a continuous circular motion with your left hand while repositioning your right hand to disguise the movement.\nAim for a smooth and flowing motion throughout the entire stroke.\n\nFngertip kneading the waist during a massage:\n\nPinch folds of flesh between your thumb and fingertips across the waist and stomach.\nKnead the area using small, slow, circular motions, lifting and turning the flesh as if you were kneading dough.\nCover the entire abdominal area thoroughly.\nTo add variation, gently shake each fold of flesh before kneading.\n\nKneading the sides of the chest during a massage:\n\nUse your palms and fingers to knead both sides of the chest in small circular motions.\nPick up the flesh between your hands and feel it roll if possible.\nFocus on using a gentle touch with your palms, heels of your hands, and fingers.\nStart from slightly above the waist and move up towards the armpit.\nReverse the stroke towards the waist and repeat several times.\nAvoid forcefully pinching flesh if you’re working on someone slim. The kneading motion with your hands is sufficient for a bony ribcage.\n\nChest circulation massage:\n\nEnsure the chest and abdomen are oiled before starting this stroke.\nPlace your hands flat with fingers pointing inwards.\nApply pressure as you move your palms upwards across the chest and abdomen.\nTurn your hands outwards slightly below the neck.\nReturn to the starting position with light pressure against the sides.\nFocus on applying pressure during the upward movement across the chest.\nYou can add variation by caressing the shoulders before returning your hands along the sides.\n\nChest lift massage technique is designed to be pleasurable and relaxing. Here’s a summary of the steps:\n\nWarm up the shoulders by rotating your cupped hands on them. Apply more oil if needed.\nGently lift and oil the back around and below the shoulder blades.\nPlace your flat hands with fingers pointing down on the shoulders.\nMove your hands down the chest, then turn your fingers to face each other as you reach the breasts.\nPress down towards the waist with your fingers facing each other.\nTurn your hands again at the waist with thumbs down.\nLift your hands up the back, lifting your partner’s back in a wave-like motion.\nReturn to the shoulders by turning your hands once.\nRemember to practice for a smooth and continuous motion.\n\nDeep chest massage for men:\n\nUse your palms and fingertips to apply pressure and knead the chest muscles.\nStart with your hands on either side of the chest, press down with your palms and use your fingertips to chisel the muscle ridges.\nMove down towards the center of the abdomen, releasing pressure as you move off the ribcage.\nGently stroke back up to the starting position.\nNote that this technique can be used on women but with very light pressure over the breasts.\n\nHead and neck massage\n\nHead massage is often neglected but offers great relaxation and pain relief.\nIt can soothe jangled nerves and ease headaches within minutes.\nRegular head massage can improve mental clarity and alertness.\nFocus on relieving tension at the base of the neck, which is common, especially in women.\n\nKey takeaways for a neck and back vibration massage:\n\nPerform this massage on a massage table if possible, as it can be strenuous on your back if done on the floor.\nSlide both hands under the shoulders, palms facing up, and fingers together.\nApply oil as you move your hands down the back about 6 inches below the neck.\nPosition your fingers on either side of the spine and press your fingertips up to lift the back.\nPull your hands up along the spine towards the neck and repeat several times.\nTo create the vibration effect, jerk your fingers up and down as you pull up.\nAvoid letting your partner help you lift their back; they should remain passive throughout the massage.\n\nNeck and Scalp Massage Techniques\nBrain Rotation:\n\nHair Stroking (Optional): Gently lift and stroke the hair upwards from the neck and scalp for relaxation.\nBrain Stimulation: Apply moderate pressure with your fingertips on the center of the skull’s base for 1-1.5 minutes using a circular motion.\n\nPressing the Neck:\n\nLifting and Stroking: Use your fingertips facing each other to lift and stroke the neck muscles with small circular motions.\nStroking Below the Ears:\nPiston Motion: Use four fingers of each hand to stroke back and forth along the large neck muscles that meet the skull below the ears.\n\nNeck and Shoulder Stroking:\n\nOil Application: Apply oil generously on the side of the neck and under the shoulder.\nCupping and Sliding: Cup your hand around the top of the neck and slide it down the side and onto the shoulder, applying pressure with your whole hand.\nReturn Stroke: Return your hand by pressing upwards with your four fingers while your thumb glides along the neck.\n\nGeneral Tips:\n\nMaintain moderate pressure throughout these techniques.\nLet your partner relax and avoid them tensing up during the massage.\n\nHead Rotation (WARNING: Use with caution):\n\nLifting the Head: Slowly lift the head with your palms at the base of the skull until slight neck muscle tension is felt.\nHead Rotation: Slowly turn the head in one direction, taking at least 15 seconds for a full revolution. Repeat for three revolutions, then pause for 10 seconds. Perform the same rotation in the other direction for three revolutions.\nNeck Stretch: While the head is upright, gently press the head forward three times to stretch the neck muscles.\nLowering the Head: Slowly lower the head back down to the ground.\n\nAlternative Maneuver (WARNING: Do not perform):\nThe text also mentions grasping the head and pulling back moderately hard while rotating. It’s strongly advised to avoid this maneuver as it can cause neck strain or injury.\nLifting and Pulling the Head (WARNING: Use with caution)\n\nHead Lift: Hold your partner’s head under the chin and skull, and gently lift it a few inches.\nHead Rotation (Limited Range): Slowly rotate the head from one shoulder to the other, stopping when slight tension is felt at the extremes of the movement. Do not force the rotation beyond a comfortable range.\nPulling and Rotating (Do not perform): The text instructs you to pull back on the chin while rotating. Avoid this maneuver as it can cause neck strain or injury.\n\nThird Eye Kinematics Temple Strokes:\nThis section talks about a massage technique focusing on the temples and the “third eye” area between the eyebrows. It emphasizes the sensitivity of this area and suggests techniques:\n\nLightly press the “third eye” with your thumb while rotating your first three fingers on the temples.\nUse a rhythmic thumb pressure variation with finger rotation on the temples.\nPerform a “piston motion” with your fingers, starting at the top of the temples and moving down to the corner of the eyes.\n\nThe forehead press is a massage technique used to target headaches, especially tension headaches. Here’s a breakdown of the steps:\n\nPlace your left hand on your partner’s forehead with your palm, fingers, and thumb flat.\nUse your right hand to add pressure on top of your left hand.\nGradually increase pressure to a firm but comfortable level for your partner.\nMaintain the pressure for 10 seconds.\nSlowly release the pressure until only the center of your left palm touches the “third eye” area (between the eyebrows).\nFinally, slowly release all contact.\n\nThe text describes a massage technique for the eyelids and surrounding areas. Here’s a breakdown with a safety warning:\nEye Massage (WARNING: Use extreme caution)\n\nThis technique involves applying pressure directly on the eye and eyelid, which is a very sensitive area.\nIt’s generally not recommended to perform massage directly on the eyeball itself.\n\nAlternative Technique:\n\nYou can focus on applying gentle pressure around the eye socket, following the suggested finger pattern but avoiding direct contact with the eyeball.\n\nThe text describes a massage technique for the face and neck, but some aspects require caution. Here’s a breakdown:\nCheek Rotation (Use with Caution):\n\nThis technique involves firmly rotating the cheeks which can be uncomfortable for some people.\n\nAlternative Technique:\n\nYou can instead use lighter circular motions on the cheeks for a gentler massage.\n\nOpening the Mouth:\n\nThe text suggests opening the mouth by pressing the chin down. It’s important to avoid forcing the mouth open if there’s tension.\n\nCritical Analysis\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nDisagreements\nAgreements\nReal-world applications\nConnections\nOther literature\nFleeting notes\nPermanent notes\nStructure notes"},"articles/project-notes/The-map-of-Success-in-Everything-3a1f9bbf55c647be937c5a05abf46258":{"slug":"articles/project-notes/The-map-of-Success-in-Everything-3a1f9bbf55c647be937c5a05abf46258","filePath":"articles/project-notes/The map of Success in Everything 3a1f9bbf55c647be937c5a05abf46258.md","title":"The map of Success in Everything 3a1f9bbf55c647be937c5a05abf46258","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The map of Success in Everything\nYou can either take money, or be given money\nYou can take it by force, or be given it in exchange for a product or service\nIf you wish to exchange for a product or service, you can either charge once, or recurringly\nFor people to buy your product or service, they need to 1. be aware. 2. trust\nAwareness → Media channels, people, advertising, referrals\nTrust → Testimonials, previous use(returning customer, Team(Owner)\nIncrease trust\nexcalidraw.com/#json=VgqOH0mt96ruU3jGDZSN7,Zn3VXr4tMSgxjralEwtx6w"},"articles/tope-arebi/21st-Century-Babbel-1f2635c581e080f98b23fd4d08c16a7c":{"slug":"articles/tope-arebi/21st-Century-Babbel-1f2635c581e080f98b23fd4d08c16a7c","filePath":"articles/tope arebi/21st Century Babbel 1f2635c581e080f98b23fd4d08c16a7c.md","title":"21st Century Babbel 1f2635c581e080f98b23fd4d08c16a7c","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"21st Century Babbel\nPost subtitle:\nBite\nSocial Media is no doubt one of the greatest feats of technological advancements of the modern age. The ability to access the thoughts and ideas of over half the 7 billion population of humanity is astounding and there are but a few things which can claim to have comparable value. Yet, we often struggle to decide whether social media has a net positive or net negative effect on society.\nThis scepticism surrounding such a cornerstone of human society is not entirely unfounded. While instant communication and exponential reach have gone a long way in transforming human lives both individually and culturally from things like crowdfunding to influencer marketing, it has also been an avenue for the spread of hate, bigotry, and terror. Doxxing, trolling and online bullying are only some of the ways through which social media is often (and quite frequently) weaponised.\nBut is the existence of social media itself to blame for the way people choose to navigate and employ its abilities. Or is there some base human instinct at play that drives us towards employing even the most benign of things for destructive purposes?\nI believe, like Adam Smith, that human existence is primarily driven by the instinct of self-preservation. From this instinct flows two base desires, love and war. In the context of this framework, it is easy to see how each and every one of us has the capacity to do great harm or great evil. Our existence is a constant struggle between these tendencies, give or take a few distractions. But first of all, why do we even have social media and why is it so successful.\nEvery species communicates, although in far less complex ways than the human species. Communication is the means through which order is born. The planets communicate their order to one another. Your dog pees around the house to communicate that it is his territory. Birds dance to communicate their desire to mate. Plant leaves communicate to their roots that they need water. But these are simple forms of communication, and so simple social structures emerge.\nAt some point x years ago, humans went from mere gesturing and grunting to using longer sound structures and eventually words to communicate their intent. The more our ability to communicate developed, the more complex our societies became. We could more clearly articulate specific things that we wanted, and we could also more specifically want certain things.\nWait but why article\nThis new ability to demand more of the external world came with the ability to better inspect our internal selves. And as our ability to shape the world to our liking grew, so too did the dissatisfaction we felt with our inner selves.\nQuote\nStudies show that while human social structures grow their ability to satisfy their needs as the members of the social group increase, this structure in facts starts to break down somewhere around 150 members. Beyond this critical mass, the structure starts to fracture\nSocial media exponentially maximises this. Not to mention that the point of social media for most people is to grow their following. This focus on reach over the optimisation of communication is both symptom and cause of an ailing social structure. Twitter is the most immediate example. Where a limit is enforced on how much you can say but at least you can say it to millions of people at once. Everyday there is talk about how people feel purposely misunderstood.\nDogs pee on furniture to signal their territories and their readiness to procreate.

This discourse has gone on so long in the public domain that the issues have become polarised. Most arguments\nThis article was inspired by this Tumblr post\n\nI will admit, I am scared of growing fat. The idea of having a huge belly with flabby folds and man boobs tortures me. I don’t stay awake at night fretting over my weight or stand in front of a mirror pinching inches of fat off my belly, (okay I do that last one). In the light of all this, the question that is yet to be answered is, am I fatphobic?\nPhobia — an extreme or irrational fear of or aversion to something\nIf you write fatphobic your text editor underlines it in red because it is not a dictionary word\nTo be clear, I am not talking about obesity because I believe simply by definition it would be ridiculous to argue against it. Also, everybody and everybody’s body is different. Even with the same composition, two bodies can look drastically different due to differing morphology. Still, I am scared of being fat and I have reasons.\nBody Surface Area\nStudies show that regardless of body weight, the amount of total body surface area is a prognostic marker in chronic heart failure patients and a predictor of coronary artery calcium. Those are direct quotes so don’t ask me what those words mean but essentially, the more body surface area you have, the more at risk your heart is regardless of your body weight. Interestingly enough, this applies not only to fat but muscle as well. So bodybuilders who also have larger body surface areas than normal also face this challenge.\ncommonly shared depiction of muscle and fat at same weight\n\nsupposedly more accurate depiction of muscle and fat at the same weight\n\nIf you are concerned about your heart health as I am, ideally, at whatever weight you are, you want to have more muscle than fat seeing as muscle takes up way less surface area than fat. Below is a commonly shared image of the difference between meat and muscle mass at the same weight alongside a more accurate rendition.\nI have not fact-checked the actual difference in measurements between muscle and fat at the same weight but these images are taken from the article “Myth Busted: Muscle vs. Fat” and should be a fairly accurate representation.\nVisceral fat\nBody fat is useful. Even necessary and healthy. But not all fat is created the same. Visceral fat is fat that is stored in the stomach (abdominal cavity if you want to get technical. Again, not a doctor). The problem with this is that it is right next to several organs which are vital to your continued living. These are the liver, the stomach (see why people use technical terms) and the intestines.\nBecause visceral fat is inside the abdominal cavity you can’t see it. Most of the fat you can see on your body is subcutaneous fat which is stored right under the skin and is not that big a deal or at least not as big a deal as visceral fat. The general rule of thumb however is that 10% of all body fat is visceral fat so the more fat you have in general, the more visceral fat you have. Also if your waist measures 35 inches or more (for women) and 40 inches or more (for men) you likely have a significant amount of visceral fat but that’s neither here nor there.\nSurgery\nIf you’ve ever stood in an operating room and watched someone you love get cut up in the stomach as I have, you may develop a healthy fear of fat in general because it looks frightening.\nVanity\nMy mind has been so conditioned by social media, Instagram in particular, that I want to look good in clothes. And not just that, I want to look good out of them too. Ridiculous I know but how can I possibly fight against 21st-century technological brainwashing.\nJokes aside though, in a world that’s constantly creaming about the importance of the freedom of identity expression I am not shocked that the fitness industry gets as much flak as it does because, yes, it can get dark. What I am shocked about is how regular people who set body goals for themselves and work hard to achieve them have come to be labelled as hateful of people who don’t share similar goals. So I can identify as an evil spirit and get body modification surgery to bring out the real me but I can’t do push-ups for a six-pack or I am fatphobic? Which of these is more symptomatic of an irrational fear?\nI can’t help but wonder if the reason is that one of these roads to identity realization can simply be bought while the other requires actual work.\nDiscipline\nAnd now the reason why I am scared of being fat. It is not so much discipline as much as it is the lack of it. I am afraid that if I am unable to achieve the body that I desire or at least avoid the one that I do not, then that is proof that I am incapable of setting my mind to a goal and accomplishing it. Our bodies and our minds are the only things we have full control of in our lives. Barring certain conditions, we are the sole determiners of how and how much we develop our minds and our bodies. And we must recognise that these are decisions that have a profound impact on the quality of our lives, beyond name-calling.\nDisclaimer\nI understand that there are conditions in which people indeed are afraid of the bodies they inhabit and the form they take but quite often those are diagnosable and sometimes complex conditions which require treatment, not stigmatization. The worth of an individual cannot be determined based on their outward appearance or body mass. There are no studies to support this. There are however already words to describe humans who engage in this behaviour, asshole being the most common.\nWe should learn to appreciate people and their identities on all sides of the divide. ANd more importantly, we should learn to accept ourselves, our fears and our prejudices and be alright with them. Because it is these things that truly make us human. And we are all of us after all, human.\nPost subtitle:\nQuestions to answer before writing this essay\n\nWhat should the reader learn from this essay?\nWhy should the reader care?\nWhat emotions or sentiments should be evoked in the reader?\nHow will you achieve this?\nReader delights.

What should the reader learn from this essay?\nThat love is hard. Even with the right person, it requires hard work and dedication if it is to survive. Love, like anything else worth anything, is difficult and takes work and intentionality to survive\n2. Why should the reader care?\nLove is an inextricable part of our existence. Religiously it is ordained by the Abrahamic god as a sacred institution that houses sex. Biologically it serves our self-interested interest of continuing our existence through children and provides insurance against the uncertainties of life. Such as sickness or poverty.\n3. What emotions or sentiments should be evoked in the reader?\nThe reader should feel hopeful about love and view it with a little more gravity than perhaps they already do. They should desire to be more intentional in their dealings with their current or future partners.\n4. How will you achieve this?\nIn the article, I will emphasise the prospect of benefiting from investing intentionally in relationships. How this investment can see one reap greater returns from their relationships.\n5. Reader delights. How will you entertain the reader? (Aim for 2 points)\n6. Key learnings.

And this is not necessarily exploitative. There is this misconception that in a relationship, 1 + 1 = 3 when it is really somewhere between 1 and 1.5 .\nKey-Resource: Book of Quotations\nTL/DR: Article abstract.\nStructure:\nWrite this after finishing the article\nShare Thoughtfood\nChew\nThe belief that intra-specie relations must yield exponential value to be worthwhile is correlational to the rise of the concept of individual primacy among humans. For most of human existence, it has been established that man is a social creature and necessarily communal. We even have the whole ass idiom “it takes a village”. However, with the advancement of technology and the decreasing need to rely on one another for an increasingly greater number of things, human society has become much more willing to be independent.\nThe evidence of this can be seen in the distribution of problems among countries. Developed countries face existential threats to the fabric of their society owing to issues of identity while developing countries are faced with challenges much lower on Maslow’s pyramid.\nThis relationship between needs and communality also surfaces in love. Passion tends to be stronger when we are young and much less fulfilled as opposed to our older years when we are striving towards more socially-oriented goals. There is simply more room at the bottom of the pyramid than at its top.\n\nAs societies and individuals move further up the pyramid, the need for companionship or rather, the expectation of what companionship should provide is gradually altered. (People start to want more out of their partners because they expect them to be either at a similar or higher level on the pyramid as they are. But the further up each party is, the less ideal the match becomes).\nIntroduction/Hook\n\nWhat is the objective?\nJustification.

Why should they read it?\nLove is the most romanticised concept of human existence, which is understandable given that the idea of being in love is to act in a manner that is considered romantic by another party. And yet, this romanticisation has had an adverse effect on not just how we love, but what we expect from the institutions it births; relationships and marriage.

Given that I do not recall why I was wondering about the topic at the time. Although I am occassionally obsessed with Gods and our  follows interpretations of them.\nBut while reading it, I realised that this was an opportunity for self reflection. Instead of just publishing it as is, I have the unique opportunity to critique my thought process at the time. To community note myself so to speak.\nWhat follows is a sort of response to a letter from myself 3 years in the future. A self-examination of man, of thought, of god, of words, Which  you could argue are all one thing.\nBite\nReligion is a touchy subject. Maybe even more so than identity politics. I suppose that is why as much criticism as the major religions have come to receive, the debates have never been as heated as perhaps any other topic. Perhaps due to the long history of violence that precedes each religion in its own right, we have developed a healthy fear, if not respect for issues that fall into the realm of the heavens. Another possible explanation is that we all have some sort of lingering fear of the as of yet unproven inexistence that is God. I know that I do, in my quiet moments, when I am scared, I will sometimes say a little prayer to the heavens.\nWe will disagree with religions, their beliefs and principles. We will criticize the actions of its adherents. Yet we will never have an outright falling out with the institution itself. We compromise even when we see no reason to. I do no know if we do it for physical or metaphysical reasons, but I imagine the day is coming when the only gods we are willing to recognise, are ourselves.\nI find this bit amusing because after reading it and just looking at the world around, religion is obviously a very very heated topic. It is also doubly interesting because after a year in the Uk, with my social media feed showing me a whole new range of opinions and ideas from people I would never have interacted with at the time, I have come to form an opinion that identity politics is not that divorced from religious ideology at all. Identity politicss here being current a\nShare Thoughtfood\nChew\nI find the Christian insistence on the nature of Jesus as the son of God extremely intriguing. Because in trying to develop a monotheistic system, it doesn’t seem apparent to me why anyone would insist on creating any sort of conflict or ambiguity in that concept.\nI mean, the reason why any of it is special is that at its core, Christianity brings us a “perfect God”, as opposed to other religious systems that it sought to supplant wherein the divine domains were divided among several gods. These gods were not perfect and were often defined by their particularly human conflicts and failings. Perhaps as a way for the people to not feel so powerless about their role in shaping their own lives.\nWhen the aim is to create a perfect being who is above everyone and everything, above human failing, desires, and the petty conflicts of the old gods, why create such a flaw in the story? Why give this supreme being an element of humanity? Is it because perfection is too abstract from us? In a world of imperfections such as ours, a perfect being is far removed from reality. Far less relatable. A being that sits above the earth prescribing laws and accepted behaviours is no more than a tyrant.\nThat is not to say that tyranny is not an effective form of welding power, it is. Look around and you will see tyranny works very well. It requires the very real threat of immediate and undesirable repercussions, but it works. All the power that religion wields, however, is the vague promise of a life after death. Eternal bliss or damnation ex post facto. And that would be fine except for the slight complication that you have lived already. And ex post, you will be dead already.\nEternal damnation is scary. When it has to contend with immediate suffering, however, and immediate joys, and maybe not so immediate suffering and joys but ones that exist within a considerably condensed timeline, it becomes, less appealing.\nHow then do you ‘convince the masses’ so to speak? The first thing to do is make your God more relatable. Bring him (or her) down to earth. Insert a spot of murky human darkness in the brilliant spark of the divine. This is a tried and trusted technique. We see this in the greek stories with Zeus and his excesses. Odin and the loss of his eye. Powerful beings must have their weaknesses. It is yin and yang at its essence. Finding balance.\nAs humans, implicit in our understanding of time, is the understanding that we can manipulate events and how we experience their consequences within time. We know that if we delay gratification, we may be able to heighten its experience. It is easy to teach people the value of sacrificing when they already have this natural predilection. Man has sacrificed both literally and figuratively since he attained consciousness. All you have to do is heighten the stakes. Bigger sacrifices, bigger rewards, bigger consequences. The soul, heaven, hell, eternal life. It is no surprise that all these things are intangible. For what could be greater than what is imagined?\nTo further drive this point home, Christianity teaches by example and sacrifices its own God. It amazingly manages to exhibit the idea of powerlessness in the most powerful existence in its system. The question then becomes, how do you kill off your God but still have a God?\nWell, the same way we all ensure that we live forever. We give birth to children. The children become our highest ideal. And we sacrifice for them. We even sacrifice ourselves for them. But Christianity does one better (and this is a recurring theme). It says why doesn’t the father sacrifice the child. This may seem counterintuitive but maybe it is not really. If we establish that the child is the highest aspiration for the individual. That one’s children represent the future and the potential for immortality. To give that up, to sacrifice it with your own hands, well, that takes guts. It’s a big ask. Perhaps the biggest ask of all. Perhaps that is why the reward for adherence to religion is life after death, and not something more egalitarian like say peace or comfort for those left behind. Perhaps the sacrifice required is so demanding, that the reward must be just as selfish and outrageous to be worth it. And the Christ is the perfect vessel to communicate that message. The herald of the ascent to an eternal pure land. The sacrifice to reward your sacrifice."},"articles/tope-arebi/Navigating-tomorrow's-workplace-Career-skills-of-t-1f2635c581e0809b9664f5f0d4872c4b":{"slug":"articles/tope-arebi/Navigating-tomorrow's-workplace-Career-skills-of-t-1f2635c581e0809b9664f5f0d4872c4b","filePath":"articles/tope arebi/Navigating tomorrow's workplace Career skills of t 1f2635c581e0809b9664f5f0d4872c4b.md","title":"Navigating tomorrow's workplace Career skills of t 1f2635c581e0809b9664f5f0d4872c4b","links":["tags/FutureOfWork","tags/SkillsForSuccess","tags/CareerDevelopment","tags/ProfessionalGrowth","tags/FutureProofBusiness"],"tags":["FutureOfWork","SkillsForSuccess","CareerDevelopment","ProfessionalGrowth","FutureProofBusiness"],"content":"Navigating tomorrow’s workplace: Career skills of the future\nThe last few years have seen such technological advancements that the business space is practically unrecognisable from what it was barely a decade ago. The success of generative AI and its near unimpeded advancement is an indication that this pace will not be easing up anytime soon. In this business environment, the workplace of the future demands a new set of skills that will define who can build a thriving career.\nFor businesses as well, this means that there is a new set of skills - both soft skills and hard - to look out for when recruiting talent\n1. Digital Literacy and Tech Savviness:\nTechnological advancements are being driven by technology. Undoubtedly, anyone aiming to succeed in today’s workplace cannot be satisfied with basic digital literacy, they must be tech-savvy in a way that they are comfortable navigating new and cutting-edge technological platforms. This means they should be well-grounded in the foundations of technology, and not just adept at using one particular system.\nWhat this looks like in practice: Value an understanding of the fundamentals of domains such as data analytics, blockchain, artificial intelligence etc, over the ability to complete tasks using one software\n2. Adaptability and Flexibility:\nAny business expert is familiar with the term VUCA. This refers to the Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous environment that organisations operate in. At no other time in history has this ever been more true than at present. As generative AI continues to evolve, 2024 is going to witness perhaps the largest period of business disruption. The ability to adapt to new situations and technologies in this era will be the key to building a thriving career or business\nWhat this looks like in practice: Adaptability is a mindset, not a skill. Do not wait until the situation forces you to adapt, build the mindset of adaptability by constantly trying new things and maintaining your curiosity about technology, problems and even people.\n3. Emotional Intelligence:\nAs automation continues taking over increasingly complex tasks, emotional intelligence and its related social skills become even more valuable. Empathy, communication, self-awareness and self-motivation are essential for effective collaboration and leadership.\nWhat this looks like in practice: As technology becomes increasingly democratised, what will differentiate between high-performing individuals and indeed businesses, is not the technology being leveraged, but how well it can be used to drive performance. The effects of corporate culture on performance are well understood. Building an environment of trust and understanding can be the key factor for creating high-performing teams and sustaining them through critical business stages, especially for startup teams.\n4. Critical Thinking and Problem Solving:\nBusinesses are generating and collecting so much data that it is easy to feel overwhelmed. The ability to analyse, critically evaluate and synthesize new information from this data trove is indispensable. Any professionals who can approach problems with a strategic and creative mindset to innovate sustainable solutions will be highly sought after by businesses that wish to succeed.\nWhat this looks like in practice: Professionals adept at critical thinking cannot just analyse and interpret data, but develop insights and initiatives to transform the business based on that data. This requires a willingness to question assumptions and consider alternative perspectives in the quest for success. It manifests in ways such as pivoting business strategy or developing targeted marketing campaigns based on past performance.\n5. Entrepreneurial Mindset:\nWhether you are working for a business or starting your own, the ability to think entrepreneurial, to be able to identify opportunities and take ownership of the solution development and implementation processes will set professionals apart and elevate them to become indispensable members of any workplace environment. The entrepreneurial mindset enables individual to see challenges not as obstacles, but as opportunities for growth for themselves and their teams, and by extension, the organisation at large.\nWhat this looks like in practice: Practical application of the entrepreneurial mindset is demonstrated in the willingness to take ownership of the solution development process. This could include collaborating with cross-functional teams, empowering individuals to contribute to ideation and taking measures to ensure that the required outcomes are reached rather than that tasks are completed.\nThe future of work is exciting for individuals equipped with the right combination of skills and mindset. Professionals who choose to grow alongside or even ahead of technology cannot be left behind by workplaces of the future. Rather they are well positioned to become organisational pillars themselves whether leading their  businesses or as part of a larger team.\nWhether you are a seasoned professional, just starting your career or building a future-proof business, investing in these areas will ensure that your business is not enduring, but performing at a level that positions you as a valuable contributor to the workplaces of tomorrow.\nWhich future of work skill are you focusing on developing?

People who could not go to the shops without a poc/immigrant holding their hands and pointing out their left from their right know exactly where the lines of racial divide stand and which side of it they, and you especially, are on.\nGemini:\nThe global flight from economic hardship has often led to unexpected and ironic consequences, particularly for those seeking refuge in developed nations.  This essay will explore a darkly satirical, perhaps even dystopian, vision of this phenomenon, focusing on the potential trajectory of African migration in the face of persistent economic disparity.  It posits that, in their pursuit of a better life, African migrants may inadvertently find themselves ensnared in a new form of servitude, one that inverts traditional power dynamics while simultaneously reinforcing deeply entrenched racial hierarchies. This new societal order, characterized by an aging and increasingly infirm Caucasian population, relies heavily on a workforce predominantly composed of African and other dark-skinned immigrants. While these immigrants are compensated for their labor, often in the essential sector of healthcare, and provide a crucial service, their position remains precarious. They are rendered vulnerable by the capricious whims of the very individuals they serve, individuals who, despite their physical dependence, are acutely aware of the societal lines of race and privilege.  This essay will delve into the unsettling reality where the quest for economic salvation leads, ironically, to a future where the boundaries of freedom and subservience are redrawn, not by chains, but by the invisible yet impenetrable walls of systemic inequality.\nChatGPT:\nIn recent years, a striking paradox has emerged as economic migrants from Africa flee harsh economic conditions in search of better opportunities abroad. Many find employment in sectors like healthcare, where their labor is undeniably essential. Yet, in doing so, they may inadvertently be entrenching themselves in a modern form of servitude that reflects a grim reality: a dystopian future where aged and ailing Caucasians are cared for by a disproportionately African and dark-skinned workforce. This phenomenon, while ostensibly offering economic upliftment, reveals a troubling dynamic of dependency, exploitation, and entrenched racial hierarchies.\nAlthough these healthcare workers are compensated for their labor, they remain at the mercy of ever-changing immigration laws and the capricious whims of the very people they care for—patients who rely on them for their most basic needs but harbor no illusions about the racial and social divides that separate them. The irony is palpable: individuals too infirm to navigate a grocery store without assistance seem acutely aware of the boundaries of racial division and their place within them. This essay will explore how this dependency-driven relationship, fueled by global inequalities and aging Western demographics, perpetuates a troubling cycle of economic migration, systemic exploitation, and social stagnation.\nExploration\nIdea context\nThe UK is constantly creating new laws and incessantly discussing the idea of unchecked migration both legal and illegal.\nQuestions and uncertainties (ideas for further research)\nImmigration vs Expatriation?

Which mean the optimal social persona had to be shaped around the true self by making countless mini adaptations to ensure survival. In solitude, you could shed off the social shell to unearth your true self. To revert. Nowaday, social life is everywhere. Constantly in the palm of our hands. So we never have time to drop the shell. To be our real selves. Always constantly making tiny adaptations to push all the right social markers forward.

Because you will be just like everybody.\nThis micro-adapted skin suit is self-evident when we consider behaviour in the context of different social environment. We can emphasise or suppress certain qualities of our personality depending on the social context within which we find ourselves. We can be more nurturing with family, more brash at work, more patient with parents.\nWhat we end up with is a collection of multiple social shells which we can switch into or deploy depending on the social context.\nThe question then is, is the true self the amalgamation of all these selves, or is it what remains when we strip them all away.\nIdea context\nRobert Greene’s interview with Diary of a CEO on power and seduction in which he quotes the idea of the public self as a role to be played in social gatherings, and a mask to be shed once one arrives home.

No matter how may times a word is described in a book of definitions, the meaning of a word will always be contextual. That is simply the nature of human society. Words are simply a tool for communicating, and so our interpretation of them is always inferred from the situation in which they are used. They can be purpose fit. This is why we can understand what words mean even when we have not heard them used before. But in the situation, we can understand their intent. And it does not matter what an Oxford or Longman has to say about it. They can only catch up.\nThe word Atheism is a label as well. And contextually, it has come to mean a person who fervently rejects the idea that there there is a God. I can understand this vehemence from previous religious adherents who, upon realising they have been conned, lash out for having been taken from a fool. However, the definition of atheism has more broad connotations than this.\nAtheism is an absence of belief in the existence of deities. While the rejection of belief in deities and the belief that there are no deities are also implicit in this, they are subset of a much broader worldview. But just as we all experience life in an almost infinite number of ways, our relationship with the divine can manifest in as many ways as well.\nThese days, when asked what my religion is, which is often given the origin of my name, the atheist label is the only one available to me given my limited options.

Target Audience: Members of the department of digital IT at the University of Salford. Approximate Duration: 30 minutes Tone: Engaging, storytelling-focused, practical, forward-looking.\nSlide 1: Title Slide\n\n\nSlide Title: Unlocking Our Collective Expertise: The Power of Personal Process Notes &amp; AI-Driven Insights\n\n\nKey Content Points:\n\n\n[Your Name]\n\n\nDigital IT Department, University of Salford\n\n\n[Date of Presentation]\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Speaker Notes:\n\n\n(Start with a welcoming and confident tone) “Good morning/afternoon, everyone. Thank you for being here today.”\n\n\n“My name is [Your Name], and I’m excited to share some thoughts on a topic I believe holds significant potential for us all: ‘Unlocking Our Collective Expertise’.”\n\n\n“We’ll be looking at the power of personal process notes and how, eventually, we could even leverage AI to gain further insights.”\n\n\n\n\nVisual Suggestion:\n\nA clean, professional background. Perhaps an abstract image representing interconnectedness, knowledge, or a subtle University of Salford branding element if appropriate. A stylised key unlocking a network or brain icon.\n\n\n\nSlide 2: Introduction &amp; Our Journey Today\n\n\nSlide Title: Why We’re Here &amp; What We’ll Explore\n\n\nKey Content Points:\n\n\nA fresh look at “documentation.”\n\n\nThe untapped power of our individual knowledge.\n\n\nImmediate wins for individuals, teams, and the department.\n\n\nA vision for future, AI-enhanced insights.\n\n\nYour role in shaping this.\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Speaker Notes:\n\n\n(Engaging hook) “How many of us have ever thought, ‘If only I knew how they did that,’ or ‘I wish I’d written down how I solved that tricky issue last time’?”\n\n\n“Today, I want us to take a fresh look at ‘documentation’ – not as a chore, but as a powerful tool. We’ll explore the often-untapped power of our individual, everyday process knowledge.”\n\n\n“We’ll discuss the immediate, tangible benefits this can bring – for our own efficiency, for smoother handovers, for easier onboarding, and for preserving critical know-how within our department.”\n\n\n“Then, we’ll look a little further ahead at an exciting vision: how we might one day use AI to amplify these benefits, helping us make smarter strategic decisions and further streamline how we work.”\n\n\n“And most importantly, I want to discuss how each of you can play a part in this, starting with some very simple steps.”\n\n\n\n\nVisual Suggestion:\n\nA roadmap or journey graphic with icons representing the key agenda points. Or a lightbulb icon turning on, symbolising new perspectives.\n\n\n\nSlide 3: A Little About Me &amp; My Passion for This\n\n\nSlide Title: My Journey to This Idea\n\n\nKey Content Points:\n\n\nRelatively new to the Digital IT team – excited to contribute!\n\n\nA lifelong “note-taker” (ask my childhood self about lists!).\n\n\nAcademic background: 2 Master’s degrees, 3 research papers.\n\n\nRelevant research: “AI-Driven Knowledge Management Systems.”\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Speaker Notes:\n\n\n“Before we dive deeper, and as I’m still getting to know many of you, perhaps a very brief word on why this subject is particularly close to my heart.”\n\n\n“I’m [Your Name], and I’m relatively new to our fantastic Digital IT team here at Salford, but I’m incredibly keen to contribute and learn from you all.”\n\n\n“You could say my interest in organising information started young – I was definitely that child who obsessively made lists for just about everything! Some habits stick, I suppose!”\n\n\n“More formally, my academic journey, which includes two Master’s degrees, has allowed me to delve deeply into how organisations learn, manage information, and innovate. This led to several research papers, including one specifically titled ‘AI-Driven Knowledge Management Systems’.”\n\n\n“So, exploring how we can better capture, share, and leverage knowledge, especially with emerging technologies, isn’t just a professional interest; it’s something I’m genuinely passionate about. And I believe there’s a real, practical opportunity for us here.”\n\n\n\n\nVisual Suggestion:\n\nA simple, friendly photo of yourself (optional). Or, icons representing education (graduation cap), research (magnifying glass/document), and perhaps a subtle, stylised “AI brain” or network icon.\n\n\n\nSlide 4: The Knowledge Around Us: Explicit vs. Tacit\n\n\nSlide Title: Understanding Our Knowledge Landscape\n\n\nKey Content Points:\n\n\nExplicit Knowledge: Codified, documented (manuals, official guides). The “Know-What.”\n\n\nTacit Knowledge: Experiential, intuitive, hard to articulate. The “Know-How.”\n\n\nOur official notes are great for explicit knowledge.\n\n\nBut what about the “secret sauce” – our collective tacit wisdom?\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Speaker Notes:\n\n\n“To understand the opportunity before us, it’s helpful to distinguish between two fundamental types of knowledge within any organisation, including ours.”\n\n\n“First, there’s Explicit Knowledge. This is the knowledge that’s easily articulated, written down, codified, and shared. Think of our official departmental procedures, our system manuals, our shared knowledge base articles. It’s the essential ‘know-what’.”\n\n\n“Then, there’s Tacit Knowledge. This is far more personal, deeply rooted in individual experience, intuition, and context. It’s the practical skills, the ‘tricks of the trade’, the ‘gut feelings’ about how to solve a novel problem, the efficient shortcuts we discover. It’s the invaluable ‘know-how’.”\n\n\n“Our current departmental notes do an excellent job capturing explicit knowledge, and that’s vital.”\n\n\n“But my question today is: how effectively are we capturing and sharing that vast reservoir of tacit wisdom – the ‘secret sauce’ that each of you brings to your roles every day?”\n\n\n\n\nVisual Suggestion:\n\nA two-part diagram. One side an open book or document icon (Explicit), the other a silhouette of a head with gears or a lightbulb inside (Tacit). Arrows showing current systems capture explicit well, but tacit is often uncaptured.\n\n\n\nSlide 5: The Reality of Uncaptured Know-How (Interactive)\n\n\nSlide Title: Ever Felt This? The Power of “Unwritten Rules”\n\n\nKey Content Points:\n\n\nQuick show of hands:\n\n\nFaced a tricky, “off-script” task recently?\n\n\nPossess unique solutions/shortcuts not in official guides?\n\n\n\n\nThis gap is where opportunity lies.\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Speaker Notes:\n\n\n“Let’s make this concept of uncaptured tacit knowledge a bit more concrete with a quick interactive moment.”\n\n\n“By a quick show of hands – and please be honest! – how many of us, perhaps in the last month or so, have found ourselves tackling a task that was a bit ‘off-script’ from the standard procedure, and it gave you a bit more trouble or took longer than expected simply because you didn’t have that one specific piece of insight or prior experience? (Pause, observe hands, acknowledge).”\n\n\n“Okay, quite a few of us. Now, another quick show of hands: how many of us have developed our own specific, hard-earned experience, a useful ‘trick’, or a shortcut for some of our regular tasks that isn’t written down in any official guide, but you know it saves time or solves a common problem effectively? (Pause, observe hands, acknowledge).”\n\n\n“Thank you. That gap – between the challenges many of us just acknowledged facing, and the undocumented solutions and efficiencies that others possess – is precisely where personal process documentation can make a real, immediate difference. It’s about connecting those dots.”\n\n\n\n\nVisual Suggestion:\n\nTwo simple, large question mark icons or thought bubble icons. Or silhouettes of people with raised hands. Keep it clean and focused on the audience’s participation.\n\n\n\nSlide 6: Introducing: Personal Process Documentation\n\n\nSlide Title: Personal Process Notes: Your Know-How, Documented\n\n\nKey Content Points:\n\n\nConcise notes on how you execute specific tasks.\n\n\nNot novels, but practical, actionable guides for you (and potentially colleagues).\n\n\nStrategic Focus (Not “Document Everything!“):\n\n\nCritical/High-Impact tasks (projects, goals).\n\n\nComplex or Infrequently Performed procedures.\n\n\nTasks with “Gotchas” or common pitfalls.\n\n\nLikely for handover/delegation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Speaker Notes:\n\n\n“So, what’s the first step in bridging this gap? I propose something straightforward: Personal Process Documentation.”\n\n\n“This is simply about each of us taking concise, practical notes on how we execute our specific tasks and projects. Think step-by-step guides for recurring tasks unique to your workflow, checklists for complex procedures, notes on troubleshooting common issues you encounter, or key contacts for specific parts of a process.”\n\n\n“Crucially, this isn’t about writing novels or creating burdensome new official documents. It’s about creating practical, actionable notes primarily for your own benefit, which can then easily benefit others.”\n\n\n“And I want to be absolutely clear: this isn’t about trying to document every single micro-action we take. That would be overwhelming and counterproductive. The key is to be strategic and focus our efforts. We should prioritise documenting processes or tasks that are:”\n\n\n“Firstly, Critical or High-Impact – those directly tied to key projects, our individual performance goals, or core departmental objectives.”\n\n\n“Secondly, Complex or Infrequently Performed procedures – where details are easily forgotten between instances.”\n\n\n“Thirdly, tasks known to have ‘Gotchas’ or common pitfalls not covered in official guides.”\n\n\n“And finally, tasks you anticipate needing to pass on or explain to others in the future.”\n\n\n“It’s about targeted documentation that delivers the most value for the effort involved.”\n\n\n\n\nVisual Suggestion:\n\nAn icon of a notebook and pen, or a stylised checklist. Bullet points on the slide could have small, relevant icons (e.g., target for critical, brain for complex, warning sign for gotchas, people icon for handover).\n\n\n\nSlide 7: The Immediate Wins: For You, The Individual\n\n\nSlide Title: What’s In It For You? (Starting Today!)\n\n\nKey Content Points:\n\n\nEnhanced personal efficiency &amp; clarity.\n\n\nReduced cognitive load (less to remember!).\n\n\nEasier to pick up tasks after a break.\n\n\nConsistency in your own work.\n\n\nA foundation for self-reflection &amp; improvement.\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Speaker Notes:\n\n\n“Let’s talk about the immediate, tangible benefits of this simple practice, starting with what’s in it for you as an individual.”\n\n\n“Firstly, it brings enhanced personal efficiency and clarity. Documenting your process forces you to think it through, often revealing simpler or better ways to do things.”\n\n\n“It reduces your cognitive load. You don’t have to keep every intricate step of every process in your head. Your notes become your external brain.”\n\n\n“This makes it much easier to pick up tasks after a break, whether that’s a holiday or just switching between different projects. You can get back up to speed much faster.”\n\n\n“It promotes consistency in your own work, ensuring you don’t miss crucial steps, especially for tasks you don’t do every day.”\n\n\n“And finally, the very act of documenting can be a powerful tool for self-reflection and identifying areas for your own process improvement.”\n\n\n\n\nVisual Suggestion:\n\nAn icon of a person with a lightbulb above their head, or a smoothly turning gear. Focus on individual empowerment.\n\n\n\nSlide 8: The Immediate Wins: Smoother Handovers &amp; Onboarding\n\n\nSlide Title: Powering Up Our Team: Handovers &amp; Onboarding\n\n\nKey Content Points:\n\n\nDramatically smoother handovers (holidays, role changes).\n\n\nReduced burden on colleagues taking over.\n\n\nFaster, more effective onboarding for new hires/internal moves.\n\n\nCaptures the “how-to” beyond official manuals.\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Speaker Notes:\n\n\n“The individual benefits are compelling, but the positive impact quickly extends to our colleagues and the wider team, especially when it comes to handovers and onboarding.”\n\n\n“Imagine how much smoother handovers could be – whether someone is going on annual leave, moving to a new role within the department, or even leaving the university. Their personal process notes provide an invaluable head-start for the person stepping in.”\n\n\n“This significantly reduces the burden and stress on colleagues taking over tasks, allowing them to become productive much faster.”\n\n\n“For new hires, or for existing staff moving into new roles within Digital IT, these notes can make their onboarding experience dramatically faster and more effective. They get access not just to the official manuals, but to the practical, day-to-day ‘how-to’ from experienced team members.”\n\n\n“This is about capturing that crucial operational wisdom that often lives only in people’s heads.”\n\n\n\n\nVisual Suggestion:\n\nTwo figures shaking hands or passing a baton. Or a “welcome” sign with an arrow showing an upward trajectory (faster onboarding). Icons representing different roles in IT (BA, Dev, Service Desk) connecting.\n\n\n\nSlide 9: The Immediate Wins: Safeguarding Our “Generational Knowledge”\n\n\nSlide Title: Protecting Our “Secret Sauce”: The Knowledge Cliff\n\n\nKey Content Points:\n\n\nMany organisations have long-serving, deeply knowledgeable staff.\n\n\nRisk: “Generational Knowledge Cliff” if many depart around the same time.\n\n\nLosing invaluable, hyperspecific “secret sauce.”\n\n\nPersonal documentation now helps retain this vital experience.\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Speaker Notes:\n\n\n“There’s another critical, immediate benefit, especially relevant for established organisations like ours that are fortunate to have many dedicated, long-term staff.”\n\n\n“Over many years, invaluable, often highly specific operational knowledge – what we might call the ‘secret sauce’ that keeps things running optimally – naturally becomes concentrated with our most experienced colleagues.”\n\n\n“A common pattern we observe is that these groups of long-serving staff, having shared similar career journeys, may also approach significant milestones, like retirement, within a similar general timeframe. This isn’t a criticism; it’s a natural lifecycle.”\n\n\n“The risk, however, is what we could term a ‘Generational Knowledge Cliff.’ If several key individuals with this deep, tacit knowledge depart concurrently, the department can face a sudden and substantial loss of critical operational wisdom, creating a knowledge vacuum that’s incredibly hard to fill quickly.”\n\n\n“By actively promoting and creating personal process documentation now, we provide a vital mechanism to capture and retain this invaluable, often unwritten, experience before it walks out the door. This safeguards our operational continuity and our collective know-how for the future.”\n\n\n\n\nVisual Suggestion:\n\nAn image of a vault or a treasure chest, symbolising valuable knowledge. Or a graph showing a “cliff edge” with an arrow showing documentation as a safety net.\n\n\n\nSlide 10: The Immediate Wins: Team &amp; Departmental Effectiveness\n\n\nSlide Title: Stronger Together: Department-Wide Gains\n\n\nKey Content Points:\n\n\nImproved collaboration (understanding each other’s workflows).\n\n\nExcellent resource for informal cross-training.\n\n\nOrganic emergence of best practices.\n\n\nPotential for reduced errors and greater consistency.\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Speaker Notes:\n\n\n“The ripple effects continue, boosting overall team and departmental effectiveness.”\n\n\n“When individuals document their processes, it fosters improved collaboration. It becomes easier to understand how colleagues approach related tasks, leading to better integration of efforts.”\n\n\n“These notes become an excellent resource for informal cross-training. Team members can more easily learn aspects of each other’s roles, increasing our collective resilience and flexibility.”\n\n\n“This can lead to the organic emergence and adoption of best practices. As people share their efficient methods, others can learn from them, naturally raising the bar for the whole department.”\n\n\n“And ultimately, clearer, documented processes have the potential to lead to reduced errors and greater consistency in how we deliver our services and projects.”\n\n\n\n\nVisual Suggestion:\n\nA group of diverse people working together, or interconnected gears working smoothly. Icons representing different IT functions (analysis, development, support, delivery) linked together.\n\n\n\nSlide 11: Summary of Immediate Gains – The Power in Our Hands Today!\n\n\nSlide Title: The Value Proposition: Clear &amp; Present Benefits\n\n\nKey Content Points:\n\n\nAll these benefits are achievable NOW.\n\n\nIncreased personal efficiency.\n\n\nSeamless handovers &amp; faster onboarding.\n\n\nSafeguarded critical experience.\n\n\nEnhanced team collaboration &amp; consistency.\n\n\nNo complex systems needed to start. Just commitment.\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Speaker Notes:\n\n\n“So, to be absolutely clear, and this is a crucial point: every benefit we’ve just covered – the increased personal efficiency, the seamless handovers, the faster onboarding, the safeguarding of critical experience, and the enhanced team collaboration – these are all significant, tangible advantages we can start realising right now.”\n\n\n“These gains are achievable simply by each of us committing to the straightforward practice of creating and maintaining our own personal process documentation. No complex systems, no lengthy development times, no major budget approvals are required for these foundational improvements.”\n\n\n“The power to make these positive changes, to improve how we work individually and collectively, is literally in our hands today. It starts with a simple decision to capture our know-how.”\n\n\n\n\nVisual Suggestion:\n\nA bold, impactful slide. Perhaps a large green tick mark next to “Benefits NOW!” or a hand holding a glowing lightbulb. Use strong, clear typography.\n\n\n\nSlide 12: The Future Amplified: AI-Powered Knowledge Leverage\n\n\nSlide Title: Looking Ahead: What If We Could Amplify This?\n\n\nKey Content Points:\n\n\nBuilding on our documented knowledge foundation.\n\n\nImagine an AI that understands our collective experience.\n\n\nNot just search, but insight generation.\n\n\nThis is a future vision, a potential evolution.\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Speaker Notes:\n\n\n“Now, having established the immediate and substantial value of capturing and manually accessing our individualised knowledge, let’s explore an exciting future possibility. This is about building on that strong foundation.”\n\n\n“What if we could then take this already powerful asset of documented personal processes and elevate its utility even further? Imagine an AI tool, securely trained on our department’s anonymised collective experience, that could understand the nuances within these notes.”\n\n\n“This wouldn’t just be a simple keyword search. We’re talking about the potential for genuine insight generation – identifying patterns, highlighting challenges, and suggesting optimisations.”\n\n\n“I want to stress that this is a future vision, a potential evolution of what we start building today. It’s not something for immediate implementation, but a glimpse of what could be possible.”\n\n\n\n\nVisual Suggestion:\n\nA slightly futuristic graphic. Perhaps a network of interconnected nodes with an “AI brain” at the centre, processing information. Or a magnifying glass over data points, revealing patterns.\n\n\n\nSlide 13: AI Benefits: Strategic &amp; Managerial Insights\n\n\nSlide Title: AI for Strategic Advantage: Managerial View\n\n\nKey Content Points:\n\n\nIdentify systemic challenges &amp; bottlenecks across processes.\n\n\nHighlight areas for optimisation &amp; standardisation (best practices).\n\n\nInform targeted training needs based on collective gaps.\n\n\nData-driven decision-making for departmental improvements.\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Speaker Notes:\n\n\n“At a strategic or managerial level, such an AI tool could offer powerful capabilities.”\n\n\n“It could help identify systemic challenges and bottlenecks that might be occurring across multiple individuals’ processes, even if each person only sees their part of the problem.”\n\n\n“It could highlight areas for optimisation and standardisation by comparing different approaches to similar tasks documented by various team members, helping us uncover and adopt true best practices.”\n\n\n“Patterns in the documented experiences could inform targeted training needs, revealing collective gaps in knowledge or skills that we could then address proactively.”\n\n\n“Ultimately, this provides a pathway to more data-driven decision-making for departmental improvements, based on the actual lived experiences of the team.”\n\n\n\n\nVisual Suggestion:\n\nA dashboard interface mock-up showing analytics or insights. Or a “big picture” view of interconnected processes with highlighted areas.\n\n\n\nSlide 14: AI Benefits: Empowering Individuals &amp; Onboarding\n\n\nSlide Title: AI for Personal Empowerment: Faster Learning\n\n\nKey Content Points:\n\n\nAccelerated, context-aware onboarding for new staff.\n\n“How do I do X for Project Y?” → AI provides curated steps.\n\n\n\n“Just-in-time” learning &amp; troubleshooting for all.\n\n\nReduces repetitive questions to mentors/seniors.\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Speaker Notes:\n\n\n“The benefits wouldn’t just be managerial; they would also significantly empower individuals, especially new team members.”\n\n\n“Imagine accelerated, context-aware onboarding. A new starter could ask the AI, ‘How do I complete the requirements gathering phase for a student portal project?’ and receive step-by-step guidance synthesized from the collective documented experiences of our seasoned Business Analysts, not just a generic manual.”\n\n\n“For all of us, it could provide ‘just-in-time’ learning and troubleshooting support. Stuck on a less frequent task? Ask the AI for a quick reminder or common solutions, drawing on the distilled wisdom of colleagues.”\n\n\n“This, in turn, reduces the burden of repetitive questions on mentors and senior staff, freeing them up for more complex challenges.”\n\n\n\n\nVisual Suggestion:\n\nA new team member confidently navigating a system with AI assistance (e.g., a chat interface). Or a “fast forward” icon applied to a learning curve.\n\n\n\nSlide 15: Our Path Forward: Proposal &amp; Call to Action\n\n\nSlide Title: Starting the Journey: Our Next Steps\n\n\nKey Content Points:\n\n\nShort-Term (Let’s start now!):\n\n\nEncourage personal process note-taking.\n\n\nShare simple templates/suggested tools (OneNote, etc.).\n\n\nVoluntary pilot group to explore &amp; share experiences?\n\n\n\n\nLonger-Term (The AI Vision):\n\n\nThis is a conversation starter.\n\n\nNo immediate implementation plan for AI.\n\n\nInterested in exploring this further? Let’s talk! (Form a working group?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Speaker Notes:\n\n\n“So, how do we move forward from here?”\n\n\n“My short-term proposal is simple and actionable: let’s start now by simply encouraging and embracing the habit of creating these personal process notes. We could share a few simple templates or suggest preferred tools that many of us already use, like OneNote, or perhaps a dedicated space within our existing knowledge base for these personal drafts.”\n\n\n“Perhaps we could even form a small, voluntary pilot group to actively try this for a month and then share their experiences and any useful templates they develop.”\n\n\n“Regarding the longer-term AI integration, I want to reiterate: this is a forward-looking vision. I understand this isn’t something that can be implemented overnight, and I don’t have a fully detailed practical implementation plan to present today for that grander vision.”\n\n\n“My primary goal with this aspect is to spark a conversation and gauge interest. If this concept of leveraging our collective experience through an intelligent system resonates with you, and particularly if anyone is interested in exploring how we might build towards this, I would be very keen to collaborate. Perhaps we could form a small, informal working group to investigate potential AI tools, consider data privacy, and outline what a future pilot project might involve.”\n\n\n\n\nVisual Suggestion:\n\nA split slide: one side showing simple tools like a notebook/pen (Short-Term), the other side a more futuristic AI icon (Longer-Term). A “Let’s Talk” or “Join the Conversation” speech bubble.\n\n\n\nSlide 16: Core Message &amp; Thank You\n\n\nSlide Title: Key Takeaway: Easy Start, Immense Benefits\n\n\nKey Content Points:\n\n\nPersonal process documentation is important.\n\n\nIt’s easy to start.\n\n\nThe benefits – immediate and future – are immense.\n\n\nLet’s unlock our collective expertise, together.\n\n\nThank You! Questions?\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Speaker Notes:\n\n\n“So, if there are just a few things to take away from our discussion today, it’s this:”\n\n\n“Personal process documentation is incredibly important for individual efficiency, team cohesion, and departmental resilience.”\n\n\n“It’s surprisingly easy to start. Focus on high-value tasks, keep it practical, and use tools you’re comfortable with.”\n\n\n“And finally, the benefits – both the immediate ones we can achieve now, and the exciting future potential with AI – are truly immense.”\n\n\n“I genuinely believe that by embracing this, we can unlock our collective expertise and make Digital IT at Salford an even more effective and supportive place to work.”\n\n\n“Thank you very much for your time and attention. I’d now be happy to answer any questions you might have or hear your thoughts.”\n\n\n\n\nVisual Suggestion:\n\nA strong, clean design. Perhaps the main presentation title again, or a graphic summarising the core message (e.g., a seed growing into a large tree). University of Salford logo. Contact information if desired.\n\n\n\nThis detailed draft should provide a solid structure and narrative for your presentation. Remember to rehearse it to get a feel for the timing and to deliver it with genuine enthusiasm!

Establish the framework of survival by social skills. Why do we do it, why do we need to?\n“Man is a social animal”. “No man is an island”. Several commonly used metaphors refer to our inability to extricate man from the act of socially interacting with other humans. This ability is the foundation of our society and civilisation. It is not a stretch to say that our complex social structures are what distinguish us from other animals. The ability to not just be social, but to build systems of cooperation and competition, has helped us master our natural environment. But what is But at what cost (Rewrite this line with a better segue)\nSocial Evolution / Evolutionary Adaptations for Social Survival\nHumans evolved physical adaptations to survive the physical environment in which we exist. At some point in the evolutionary timeline, human intelligence developed to a point where physical prowess was not the sole means for survival. The concept of survival of the fittest gained more dimensions in line with our games of competition and cooperation.  As our social systems grew in complexity, a social environment emerged within which we also needed to survive. And just as with our physical environment, we developed necessary adaptations to navigate this social space.\nIn this system, through communication, people could lose or gain power, resources and status. The act of socialisation became a test of survival fitness - failure at which could spell disaster. One consequence of this is that it became necessary for individual members of our society to hone a set of skills to navigate this social landscape. Like all optimisations, these skills had to be developed for specific circumstances and be deployable in a wide range of scenarios.\nThis involves consciously shaping ourselves and the expression of our traits and abilities However, our sense of self, our identity, is constructed through the interactions of our unconscious/subconscious mind and our experiences, usually starting from childhood. Humans thus in the course of their lives learn to maintain two layers of self, an external form that is constantly manipulated and an internal central identity that serves as the foundation for this process.\nJung explains that the development of this ability is a critical part of the journey to adulthood\nSip #1: Tim Urban has a amazing article on just how complex navigating social interactions can be waitbutwhy.com/2014/01/the-great-perils-of-social-interaction.html\nThe mechanics of social adaptation\nThis identity fragmentation is self-evident when we consider behaviour in the context of different social environments. We can emphasise or suppress certain qualities of our personality depending on the social context within which we find ourselves. We can be more nurturing with family, more brash at work, and more patient with parents. What we end up with is a collection of multiple social shells which we can switch into or deploy depending on the social context.\nBanduras theory\nJung’s theory\nSip #2: Jung explains this phenomenon as a persona or mask that a person wears in social interactions to conceal their true nature. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(psychology)\nDigital Social Spaces and Authenticity\nDigital social spaces\nOf course, today’s economy and given the general advancement of our ways of life, nothing is so critical anymore. While loss of social status is not necessarily survival related, it can be just as crippling. It may even be a thing of pride that human society is now so structured that social disability may be in fact more crippling than physical disability.\nModern social life is everywhere. Constantly in the palm of our hands. So we never have time to drop the shell. To be our real selves. Always constantly making tiny adaptations to push all the right social markers forward. Likes, followers, status, job title.\nThe lie of Relatability and Authenticity in Social media Content Creation\nConcept 1: Impact of modern technology on social life.\nConcept 2: Constant social adaptation in the digital age.\nConcept 3: Challenges to authenticity in digital social spaces.\nConcept 4: The paradox of relatability and authenticity in content creation on social media.\nMost interestingly, digital social spaces responsible for this contortion of the self advocate that the recipe for platform success includes some sort of “authenticity” or “originality”. But what even is that? Who are you when you not micro-adapting your social skin for relevance or survival. Have you met you?\nRelatable content is touted to be the most successful type of content. “If you post about how you feel, others will follow you because they feel it too”. But is this not the first crack in the glass ceiling? When you are at your most authentic, you will equally be the most relatable. Because you will be just like everybody.\nNature of the True Self/ What or who is the true self?\nConcept 1: Nature of the true self and its amalgamation.\nConcept 2: Cumulative experiences shaping identity.\nConcept 3: Existential reflection on embracing true selves and authenticity.\nConcept 4: Reflection on life as a cumulative experience, leading to existential insights.\nOne question that naturally flows from this inquisition into our identity is who or what is the true self. Is it the amalgamation of all these selves, or is it what remains when we strip them all away?\nLife is a cumulative experience. From the moment we are born, we begin to accumulate things. Skills, ideas, things, thoughts. Our social skins are one of those things as well. They are shaped by the interaction between our unique selves and unique experiences. Man is truly realised at the moment of his death. A hodgepodge of accumulated features that we salvage along the way.

These tools are how I unlock my productivity by creating more value, in less time.\nThe best part is, these tools can be used for any domain, whether you’re a creator or entrepreneur\nGrammarly: Elevate your written communication\nI think about writing not so much as a skill, but as a core human function. It is also the bedrock of corporate communication. From sending emails, to writing newsletters, Grammarly ensures that you are being clear, precise and economical in your written communication whatever form that may be. Grammarly integrates well with your keyboard, browser, word processor and even your mobile keyboard meaning you can spell-check even your text messages.\nPocket: Build a Personal Knowledge Hub\nIf we live in the age of information, Pocket is your personal guide for navigating the times. I have hd an annual pocket premium subscription for the last three years and it has been invaluable for storing information. Pocket gives your bookmarked articles a home where you can read, manage them, or store them in perpetuity if you never get around to it. While there are many read-it-later apps, Pocket’s beautiful home feed and its excellent speech to audio function means you can  listen to your saved articles on-the-go just like a podcast.\nNotion: Your All-in-One Workspace\nIf notion did not exist, this list would be a lot longer. Notion is a revolutionary notetaker that quite literally does everything. Notion is great for creating documents and notes that are easily accessible through an always present sidebar. It can create to-do-lists, kanban boards, wikis and even databases making it perfect for both personal and work-related task management.\nI have tried other similar tools like Obsidian, Logseq, Coda but I always keep coming back to Notion. I’ve also built some great templates throughout the year that I will sometimes share to help with planning and productivity.\nOmnivore: Declutter your inbox\nOmnivore is the latest tool to be added to my productivity system. Like Pocket, Omnivore acts as a capture system meaning you can save any resources to read-later. However, Omnivore does a few other things as well and it does them so well.\nFirst of all, Omnivore is open-source, meaning I have less concerns about potential sunsetting. It is also free, so none of the features are paywalled. But what is really great about Omnivore is its ability to create email inboxes for your newsletter subscriptions. I’ve been able to reduce my weekly influx of new emails by at least 80% after moving all my newsletter subscriptions to Omnivore.\nCalendar: Your digital personal assistant\nThere is nothing more efficient that a good calendar app. The google calendar with its integration with my emails and google assistant is really like having a personal assistant. I can book meetings directly into my calendar, plan events, set deadlines all in one app. Lately, I’ve been using calendar for planning by time-blocking activities throughout the week. Now I always know what I should be doing at any point in time, and when I can make up for it if something comes up to interfere with my schedule\nGoogle Tasks: Get things done\nTasks is the simplest to-do-list app I have ever used. Many other apps seem to view the traditional box-ticking function of to-do-lists as merely one small part of the problem they need to solve. So they add tons of extra features. Tasks simply lets you create lists, and list items. And it gives you a handy little widget for your homescreen where you can mark items as done as you move through your day.\nGoogle Workplace: Cloud storage\nI’m a bit of a google fanboy so this might not apply to you, but almost all of my personally generated data that is online, is linked to google. Between google docs, sheets and drive, I can usually find a personal resource that I have created at some point in time or the other. From university notes, to work templates, essays and research papers, they all live on a google server as either a document or spreadsheet making them irreplaceable no matter what tools I may rotate in or out of my productivity system.\nThese tools are the backbone of my daily workflow and I literally open them everyday. Any tasks that I need to get done, no matter what area of my life that may be in goes through one of these tools and become much easier to accomplish.\nWhat are your must-have tech tools for boosting productivity?

No matter how may times a word is described in a book of definitions, the meaning of a word will always be contextual. That is simply the nature of human society. Words are simply a tool for communicating, and so our interpretation of them is always inferred from the situation in which they are used. They can be purpose fit. This is why we can understand what words mean even when we have not heard them used before. But in the situation, we can understand their intent. And it does not matter what an Oxford or Longman has to say about it. They can only catch up.\nThe word Atheism is a label as well. And contextually, it has come to mean a person who fervently rejects the idea that there there is a God. I can understand this vehemence from previous religious adherents who, upon realising they have been conned, lash out for having been taken from a fool. However, the definition of atheism has more broad connotations than this.\nAtheism is an absence of belief in the existence of deities. While the rejection of belief in deities and the belief that there are no deities are also implicit in this, they are subset of a much broader worldview. But just as we all experience life in an almost infinite number of ways, our relationship with the divine can manifest in as many ways as well.\nThese days, when asked what my religion is, which is often given the origin of my name, the atheist label is the only one available to me given my limited options. But my relationship with the divine is so much more than that.\nSadghuru says “Do not empower someone who has a limited sense of identity.

And this is not necessarily exploitative. There is this misconception that in a relationship, 1 + 1 = 3 when it is really somewhere between 1 and 1.5.\nTL/DR: Article Abstract\nThis article explores the challenges and rewards of sustaining love in the long term. It delves into the societal shifts that have impacted our perception of love, the importance of intentionality and effort in relationships, and offers practical guidance for navigating the complexities of love’s enduring journey.\nThe Chew\nThe belief that intra-specie relations must yield exponential value to be worthwhile is correlational to the rise of the concept of individual primacy among humans. For most of human existence, it has been established that man is a social creature and necessarily communal. We even have the whole ass idiom “it takes a village”. However, with the advancement of technology and the decreasing need to rely on one another for an increasingly greater number of things, human society has become much more willing to be independent.\n1. You Are a Social Animal | Psychology Today\nwww.psychologytoday.com\nThe evidence of this can be seen in the distribution of problems among countries. Developed countries face existential threats to the fabric of their society owing to issues of identity while developing countries are faced with challenges much lower on Maslow’s pyramid.\nThis relationship between needs and communality also surfaces in love. Passion tends to be stronger when we are young and much less fulfilled as opposed to our older years when we are striving towards more socially-oriented goals. There is simply more room at the bottom of the pyramid than at its top.\nThe Consequences of Shifting Priorities\nEmbracing the Antithesis: Love as an Investment\nThe modern emphasis on individual achievement and self-reliance has inadvertently created a breeding ground for fleeting connections and disposable relationships. The allure of instant gratification and the fear of vulnerability can lead us to prioritize short-term pleasure over the enduring rewards of long-term love. We may find ourselves constantly seeking the next “best thing,” overlooking the potential for growth and intimacy that lies in nurturing existing bonds. While the pursuit of personal goals and ambitions is undeniably important, it’s crucial to recognize that genuine love requires compromise, sacrifice, and a willingness to invest in the relationship, even when it doesn’t always yield immediate returns.\nRather than viewing love as a transaction or a means to an end, let us consider it as an investment—one that requires time, effort, and unwavering commitment. Like any worthwhile investment, love may not always yield immediate dividends, but with patience, dedication, and mutual respect, it can blossom into something truly extraordinary. The rewards of long-term love are immeasurable: deep emotional connection, unwavering support, shared experiences, and the comfort of knowing that someone has your back through thick and thin. It’s a bond that transcends the superficial and provides a sense of belonging and purpose that cannot be replicated by fleeting encounters.\n1. 4 Lifelong Benefits of Long-Term Relationships | Psychology Today United Kingdom\nwww.psychologytoday.com\nNurturing Love’s Growth\nTo sustain love in the long term, we must actively nurture its growth. This involves:\n\nOpen and honest communication: Sharing thoughts, feelings, and dreams fosters intimacy and understanding.\n1. Relationships and communication - Better Health Channel\n\nwww.betterhealth.vic.gov.au\n\nMutual respect and appreciation: Recognizing each other’s strengths, supporting each other’s goals, and expressing gratitude for each other’s presence.\nShared experiences and adventures: Creating memories together strengthens the bond and keeps the spark alive.\nForgiveness and understanding: Acknowledging that mistakes happen and choosing to forgive and move forward together.\nPrioritizing quality time: Amidst busy schedules, carving out dedicated time for each other reinforces the importance of the relationship.\n\nIn today’s society, love is often viewed through a transactional lens. The prevailing narrative seems to suggest that a relationship is only valuable if it yields exponential returns, both emotionally and materially. This perspective, reflected in countless memes and Twitter threads, trivializes the profound nature of love and reduces it to a mere calculation of profit and loss. While a healthy relationship certainly brings joy, companionship, and support, it’s important to remember that love is not a guarantee of exponential returns, but rather a journey of growth and mutual support.\nThe idea that relationships must be endlessly profitable to be worthwhile is intrinsically linked to the rise of individualism in modern society. For centuries, humans understood the fundamental truth that we are social creatures, reliant on community for survival and well-being. The saying “it takes a village” encapsulates this understanding, acknowledging the interconnectedness of human lives and the power of collective support. However, technological advancements and increased self-sufficiency have gradually eroded this sense of communal reliance. We now live in a world where independence is championed and self-reliance is seen as the ultimate goal.\nThis shift towards individualism manifests in various ways, even on a global scale. Developed countries, often characterized by high levels of individual autonomy and self-sufficiency, grapple with existential crises of identity and belonging. In contrast, developing countries, where community ties remain stronger and reliance on one another is often a necessity, face challenges that are more directly related to basic needs and survival.\nThis dynamic between needs and community also plays out in the realm of love. The intensity of passion often burns brightest in our younger years, when we are still striving for self-actualization and fulfillment. As we mature and our priorities shift towards more socially-oriented goals, such as building families and contributing to our communities, the nature of love evolves as well. The fiery passion of youth may give way to a deeper, more enduring love rooted in shared values and mutual respect. There’s a profound truth to the saying that there is simply more room at the bottom of Maslow’s pyramid than at its top.\nThe transactional view of love, coupled with the rise of individualism, has led to a culture where relationships are often seen as disposable. When the initial spark fades or challenges arise, many are quick to abandon ship, believing that love should be effortless and perpetually fulfilling. However, true love is not a fairy tale; it requires dedication, compromise, and a willingness to weather the storms of life together.\nBuilding and maintaining a strong, lasting relationship requires intentional investment and effort. Just as a gardener tends to their plants, providing them with water, sunlight, and nutrients, so too must we nurture our relationships with care and attention. This means actively listening to our partners, expressing our love and appreciation, and working together to overcome challenges. It also means being willing to compromise, to forgive, and to grow together through life’s ups and downs.\nOne of the most crucial aspects of intentional investment in a relationship is open and honest communication. Sharing your thoughts, feelings, and needs with your partner creates a foundation of trust and understanding. It allows you to navigate conflicts constructively and work together to find solutions that benefit both partners. Remember, love is not about mind-reading; it’s about expressing yourself clearly and being receptive to your partner’s needs.\nAnother vital component of nurturing a relationship is spending quality time together. In today’s fast-paced world, it’s easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily life and neglect our relationships. However, carving out dedicated time for your partner, whether it’s a weekly date night or a quiet evening at home, strengthens your bond and fosters intimacy. It’s during these moments of shared experience and connection that love deepens and flourishes.\nIt’s also essential to recognize that relationships are not static; they evolve over time. As individuals grow and change, so too will their needs and desires within the relationship. Embracing this evolution and being willing to adapt and compromise is crucial for a relationship to thrive in the long run. It’s about finding new ways to connect, support each other’s dreams, and create a shared vision for the future.\nWhile the hard work of love may seem daunting, the rewards are immeasurable. A deep and meaningful relationship provides a sense of belonging, security, and unwavering support. It enriches our lives, expands our perspectives, and challenges us to become the best versions of ourselves. Love, in its truest form, is a transformative force that empowers us to navigate life’s complexities with grace and resilience.\nSo, the next time you find yourself questioning the value of love or feeling discouraged by its challenges, remember that love is not a sprint but a marathon. It requires patience, perseverance, and a willingness to invest in the long-term growth of your relationship. Embrace the hard work, nurture your connection with intentionality, and you’ll reap the rewards of a love that deepens and strengthens over time.\nKey Takeaways:\n\nLove is not a guarantee of exponential returns, but rather a journey of growth and mutual support.\nIndividualism can hinder the development of strong and lasting relationships.\nPrioritize intentional investment and effort in your relationships to reap the rewards of deep connection and fulfillment.\n\nRelevant Resource Links:\n\nThe 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman\nAttached by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller\nHold Me Tight by Sue Johnson\n\nConclusion: Love’s Enduring Legacy\nLove in the long term is not a fairy tale; it’s a conscious choice to embark on a lifelong journey with another person. It’s a commitment to weather the storms, celebrate the triumphs, and grow together through life’s ups and downs. While it may require effort and intentionality, the rewards of a lasting love are immeasurable. So let us embrace the challenge, invest in our relationships, and create a legacy of love that transcends time and leaves an indelible mark on our lives and the lives of those we hold dear."},"articles/tope-arebi/The-poly-paradox":{"slug":"articles/tope-arebi/The-poly-paradox","filePath":"articles/tope arebi/The poly paradox.md","title":"The poly paradox","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"articles/tope-arebi/Thoughtfood-Article-1f2635c581e080459279c78bfbc49d31":{"slug":"articles/tope-arebi/Thoughtfood-Article-1f2635c581e080459279c78bfbc49d31","filePath":"articles/tope arebi/Thoughtfood Article 1f2635c581e080459279c78bfbc49d31.md","title":"Thoughtfood Article 1f2635c581e080459279c78bfbc49d31","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Thoughtfood Article\nPost Title:\nPost subtitle:\nQuestions to answer before writing this essay\n\nWhat should the reader learn from this essay?\nWhy should the reader care?\nWhat emotions or sentiments should be evoked in the reader?\nHow will you achieve this?\nReader delights.

Practice moderation in all things, especially in how you eat.\nDo not hold on to possessions you o longer need\nGift your unneeded possessions to those who need it more than you do.\nDo not act following customary beliefs.\nThose who follow the status quo, will never change the world\nDo not collect weapons or practice with weapons beyond what is useful.\nPractice what works discard what doesn’t. Your time is precious, spend it wisely.\nDo not fear death\nEverybody dies eventually. Do not let the fear of death stop you from taking risks and achieving greatness.\nDo not seek to possess either goods or fiefs for your old age.\nYour possessions are of the earth and serve no purpose when you are gone. All that is left is the impact you leave behind.\nRespect Buddha and the gods without counting on their help.\nGod has already given you all the tools you need to prevail. It is up to you to use them\nYou may abandon your body, but you must preserve your honour\nNever sacrifice who you are and what you believe in.

On the intense end of the spectrum, powerlifters and many competitive bodybuilders pair very low reps (1 to 5) with extremely heavy weights (90-95% of their one-rep max).\nWhy does this work? Lifting heavier weight (approximately 70-75% of your one-rep max) activates Type 2 or “fast twitch” muscle fibers, which are important in developing strength and promoting hypertrophy (muscle growth along with an increase in the size of muscle cells).\nThe potential pitfall? Type 2 muscle fibers have greater power, but they also fatigue quickly—and muscle fiber stimulation correlates with how long they are under resistance. If they aren’t under tension long enough, they won’t be able to promote hypertrophy (muscle growth) as effectively.\nFor this reason, many people have found success with a more moderate approach (8-12 reps at 70-75% of your one-rep max). This allows you to lift enough weight to build strength and power, while also being able to extend the length of your set.\n#WeightTraining"},"zettelkasten/Improving-cardiovascular-fitness":{"slug":"zettelkasten/Improving-cardiovascular-fitness","filePath":"zettelkasten/Improving cardiovascular fitness.md","title":"Improving cardiovascular fitness","links":["tags/tag1"],"tags":["tag1"],"content":"Tags: fitness\nRelated Notes: Definition: Cardiorespiratory Endurance (Definition%20Cardiorespiratory%20Endurance%201f5635c581e08002b071f94e1e85ec9f.md)\n\nRunning\nSwimming\nCycling\nAerobics\nHIIT\n\nSource\nTags\ntag1"},"zettelkasten/Inversion-Thinking":{"slug":"zettelkasten/Inversion-Thinking","filePath":"zettelkasten/Inversion Thinking.md","title":"Inversion Thinking","links":["Health-Stagnation","Health-Decline","Personal-Disappointment"],"tags":["thinking-tools"],"content":"Inversion thinking is a powerful technique that involves identifying potential failures or negative outcomes to avoid them, rather than focusing solely on positive goals.

It was created by Japanese quality control expert, Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa, in the 1960s as a part of total quality management (TQM) methodologies.\nThe diagram looks like a fish skeleton, with the “head” representing the problem being analyzed and the “bones” representing the possible causes that contribute to the problem. Typically, the main categories of causes on the bones are people, process, equipment, materials, environment, and management, but they can vary depending on the context. The fishbone diagram allows teams to brainstorm together, organize their ideas visually, and identify the root cause(s) of the problem more efficiently by breaking it down into manageable parts.\nIshikawa’s Fishbone, also known as the Ishikawa diagram or the cause-and-effect diagram, is a visual problem-solving tool that helps identify and analyze the possible causes of a problem or issue. It resembles a fish skeleton, with the “head” representing the problem being analyzed and the “bones” representing the possible causes that contribute to the problem. The Ishikawa diagram was created by Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa, a Japanese quality control expert, in the 1960s, and is commonly used in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and software development.\nIshikawa’s Fishbone diagram can be applied to a wide range of fields, including manufacturing, healthcare, software development, education, and many others. The tool is particularly useful in situations where a problem or issue needs to be identified and analyzed systematically. Some examples of areas where the Ishikawa diagram can be used include:\n\nProduct development and manufacturing: To identify and troubleshoot issues with products, assembly lines, or machinery.\nHealthcare: To identify and understand the potential causes of patient symptoms or health issues.\nEducation: To analyze student performance or academic issues and identify underlying factors.\nInformation technology: To identify and resolve issues with software development, network infrastructure, or data management.\nBusiness management: To analyze and improve business processes, workflow, and productivity. Overall, the Ishikawa Fishbone diagram can be applied to any field that wants to analyze complex problems and identify the root causes that contribute to them.\n\nA content map is not directly related to the Ishikawa Fishbone diagram. The Ishikawa Fishbone diagram is a tool used in quality control and process improvement to identify and analyze the causes of a problem. The Fishbone diagram allows the user to visualize the potential causes leading to the problem so that they can isolate and address the root cause of a problem.\nA content map, on the other hand, is a tool used in the planning and organization of information for a specific content piece, such as a report, article, or book. Its purpose is to provide a clear and logical blueprint of how the information will be structured and presented. In this context, a content map is more related to information architecture and content design.\nWhile there is no direct connection between the Ishikawa Fishbone diagram and a content map, both tools can be used to improve the quality of an end product, whether that be a product or a piece of content. The Ishikawa Fishbone diagram helps to isolate and address any issues in a product or process, while a content map helps to structure information efficiently and effectively, providing a clear roadmap that enables readers to engage with the content quickly and easily.\nThe Ishikawa Fishbone diagram, also known as a cause-and-effect diagram or a fishbone diagram, is not a decision framework. Instead, it is a problem-solving tool that helps to identify all the causes of a problem, by grouping and visualizing them in a structured way. The Ishikawa Fishbone diagram is useful in quality control and process improvement, where a team typically starts by identifying a problem and then breaks down its potential causes into a set of categories on the fishbone diagram.  The team then will use detailed analysis of each identified cause to identify the root cause and take necessary actions to correct it. The categories of the Ishikawa Fishbone diagram include People, Methods, Materials, Machines, Measurements and Environment. A decision framework, on the other hand, is a structured mechanism or system that helps to guide decision-making by providing a set of criteria or rules to evaluate available options. Decision frameworks can involve complex algorithms or simple mental models and can be used in a variety of contexts, such as business, government, or personal decision making. Some examples of commonly used decision frameworks include the Six Thinking Hats, the Eisenhower Matrix, or even a simple list of pros and cons. In summary, the Ishikawa Fishbone diagram is not a decision framework but is instead a problem-solving tool used to identify the potential causes of a problem in a graphical way. The focus of the Ishikawa Fishbone diagram is to identify the root cause of an issue, while a decision framework is a tool that aids in the decision-making process by providing a structure for evaluating different courses of action.\n“Ishikawa’s Fishbone diagram is a problem-solving tool that enables the user to identify and break down the root causes of a problem. It has six major categories, which include people, methods, machines, materials, measurements, and environment. By organizing these categories visually in the form of a fishbone diagram, it becomes easier to analyze and break down potential causes, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of a problem.”\nThe 8 Ps of Product Marketing Product/Service Price place Promotion People Process Physical evidence Performance"},"zettelkasten/Jason-Kehe---Of-course-we-are-living-in-a-simulation-(Wired)":{"slug":"zettelkasten/Jason-Kehe---Of-course-we-are-living-in-a-simulation-(Wired)","filePath":"zettelkasten/Jason Kehe - Of course we are living in a simulation (Wired).md","title":"Jason Kehe - Of course we are living in a simulation (Wired)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"THREE THINGS NEED to happen, and probably in this order, for any crackpot idea to take hold of the culture:\n(1) its nonthreatening introduction to the masses,\n(2) its legitimisation by experts, and\n(3) overwhelming evidence of its real-world effects.\nOf Course We’re Living in a Simulation, Jason Kehe, Wired\nSee Also\n\n\n"},"zettelkasten/Kolb’s-Experiential-Learning-Cycle":{"slug":"zettelkasten/Kolb’s-Experiential-Learning-Cycle","filePath":"zettelkasten/Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle.md","title":"Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Idea summary:\nKolb’s experiential learning style theory is typically represented by a four-stage learning cycle in which the learner ‘touches all the bases’:\n\nConcrete Experience - (a new experience or situation is encountered, or a reinterpretation of existing experience).\nReflective Observation of the new experience. (of particular importance are any inconsistencies between experience and understanding).\nAbstract Conceptualization (reflection gives rise to a new idea, or a modification of an existing abstract concept).\nActive Experimentation (the learner applies them to the world around them to see what results).\n\nEffective learning is seen when a person progresses through a cycle of four stages: of (1) having a concrete experience followed by (2) observation of and reflection on that experience which leads to (3) the formation of abstract concepts (analysis) and generalizations (conclusions) which are then (4) used to test hypothesis in future situations, resulting in new experiences.\nKolb (1974) views learning as an integrated process with each stage being mutually supportive of and feeding into the next. It is possible to enter the cycle at any stage and follow it through its logical sequence.\nHowever, effective learning only occurs when a learner can execute all four stages of the model.

That said, everyone responds to and needs the stimulus of all types of learning styles to one extent or another - it’s a matter of using emphasis that fits best with the given situation and a person’s learning style preferences.\nHere are brief descriptions of the four Kolb learning styles:\nDiverging (feeling and watching - CE/RO)\nThese people are able to look at things from different perspectives. They are sensitive. They prefer to watch rather than do, tending to gather information and use imagination to solve problems. They are best at viewing concrete situations from several different viewpoints.\nKolb called this style ‘diverging’ because these people perform better in situations that require ideas-generation, for example, brainstorming. People with a diverging learning style have broad cultural interests and like to gather information.\nThey are interested in people, tend to be imaginative and emotional, and tend to be strong in the arts. People with the diverging style prefer to work in groups, to listen with an open mind and to receive personal feedback.\nAssimilating (watching and thinking - AC/RO)\nThe Assimilating learning preference involves a concise, logical approach. Ideas and concepts are more important than people. These people require good clear explanation rather than a practical opportunity. They excel at understanding wide-ranging information and organizing it in a clear, logical format.\nPeople with an assimilating learning style are less focused on people and more interested in ideas and abstract concepts. People with this style are more attracted to logically sound theories than approaches based on practical value.\nThis learning style is important for effectiveness in information and science careers. In formal learning situations, people with this style prefer readings, lectures, exploring analytical models, and having time to think things through.\nConverging (doing and thinking - AC/AE)\nPeople with a converging learning style can solve problems and will use their learning to find solutions to practical issues. They prefer technical tasks, and are less concerned with people and interpersonal aspects.\nPeople with a converging learning style are best at finding practical uses for ideas and theories. They can solve problems and make decisions by finding solutions to questions and problems.\nPeople with a converging learning style are more attracted to technical tasks and problems than social or interpersonal issues. A converging learning style enables specialist and technology abilities. People with a converging style like to experiment with new ideas, to simulate, and to work with practical applications.\nAccommodating (doing and feeling - CE/AE)\nThe Accommodating learning style is ‘hands-on,’ and relies on intuition rather than logic. These people use other people’s analysis, and prefer to take a practical, experiential approach. They are attracted to new challenges and experiences, and to carrying out plans.\nThey commonly act on ‘gut’ instinct rather than logical analysis. People with an accommodating learning style will tend to rely on others for information than carry out their own analysis. This learning style is prevalent within the general population.\nIdea context:\nSee Also\n\n\n"},"zettelkasten/Lao-Tzu-on-superior-and-inferior-virtue":{"slug":"zettelkasten/Lao-Tzu-on-superior-and-inferior-virtue","filePath":"zettelkasten/Lao Tzu on superior and inferior virtue.md","title":"Lao Tzu on superior and inferior virtue","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Tags: philosophy\nLao Tzu presents a distinction between two levels of virtue based on self-awareness:\n\n“The man of superior virtue is not conscious of his virtue, and in this way he really possesses virtue.

You can get demand, but as long as there is no supply to fulfil it, they will leave. With supply, however, users will come because they know they can get what they want. Supply is also business. They can hold space in multiple markets and operate. Demand only needs one market and will “attrit” if its needs are not met.\n\nYou may think you’re a marketplace, but you might not be…Is there a demand for the supply you’re offering?\n\nSome businesses may start out offering a market for a service. However, the fact that a service exists, does not mean there is a need for it to be “productised”. There may be no added value in the aggregation. A business may also not meet the marketplace definition, if b) it does not have the financial component/transaction element.\n\nMedian number of supply-growth levers is 2\n\nThere are many strategies to grow your supply base.

This feature is especially effective when the skill or information being learned is related to existing knowledge.\nWhen the brain encounters new stimulus, it engages neurons which send signals to one another. This process creates new projections from the neurons creating new connections and sometimes even neurons. These connections or neural pathways are like grooves mapped into the brain roadmap. Initially, these grooves are like lines in the sand and easily eroded. They are rewired and strengthened through practice or repetition.\nThe quality and type of experience also affects the strength of these connections.\nRepetition of an activity leads to repeated neuron activation. “Spaced repetition” is a learning technique employed to trigger this process. It involves the repeated review of information at increasingly spaced-out time intervals.\nMyelin is a substance that makes neurons move faster and it is stimulated by learning new things.\nThe reverse\nNeurons can also die.

This ensures the amount of sugars per serving is below the 0.5-gram threshold required for the “sugar-free” label. It’s important to note that while low in sugars, “sugar-free” Tic Tacs often contain sugar alcohols (like xylitol or sorbitol) as primary ingredients, which provide sweetness but are classified differently from sugars under FDA labeling rules."},"zettelkasten/Technique---Improving-Agility":{"slug":"zettelkasten/Technique---Improving-Agility","filePath":"zettelkasten/Technique - Improving Agility.md","title":"Technique - Improving Agility","links":["zettelkasten/Technique---Improving-Agility","tags/tag1"],"tags":["tag1"],"content":"\nCone drills\nLadder drills\n\nSource\nTechnique - Improving Agility\nTags\ntag1"},"zettelkasten/Technique-Achieving-Resonance-via-Deep-Breathing-a-":{"slug":"zettelkasten/Technique-Achieving-Resonance-via-Deep-Breathing-a-","filePath":"zettelkasten/Technique Achieving Resonance via Deep Breathing a .md","title":"Technique Achieving Resonance via Deep Breathing a ","links":["tags/breath_control"],"tags":["breath_control"],"content":"Technique: Achieving Resonance via Deep Breathing and Projection\nVocal resonance can be enhanced through specific breathing techniques.

Conversely, polarizing ideas, while potentially alienating some, might be more likely to “stick” or gain traction due to the strong reactions they provoke. This raises the question of whether the success lies in the innocuous nature of the idea itself, or specifically in an innocuous introduction of an idea that might otherwise be seen as outrageous or challenging.\nReflection on Jason Kehe - Of course we are living in a simulation (Wired)\nRelated Notes\nZeitgeist formation - Nature and Definition of Evidence in the Digital Age Zeitgeist Formation - The how\nTags\ncommunication, sociology, psychology"},"zettelkasten/Zeitgeist-formation---Nature-and-Definition-of-Evidence-in-the-Digital-Age":{"slug":"zettelkasten/Zeitgeist-formation---Nature-and-Definition-of-Evidence-in-the-Digital-Age","filePath":"zettelkasten/Zeitgeist formation - Nature and Definition of Evidence in the Digital Age.md","title":"Zeitgeist formation - Nature and Definition of Evidence in the Digital Age","links":["tags/evidence","tags/media","tags/digitalage","tags/truth","tags/credibility","tags/epistemology","Three-Stages-of-Crackpot-Idea-Cultural-Adoption"],"tags":["evidence","media","digitalage","truth","credibility","epistemology"],"content":"In the contemporary landscape dominated by new media, the definition and perception of “overwhelming evidence” is complex.
